If these symptoms persist or become worse, they should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.", "Alopecia areata is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, causing hair to fall out. The most common areas for hair loss are on the scalp and the eyebrows. In some cases, hair loss can occur on the arms and legs as well. People with alopecia areata may have one or more patches of hair loss on their scalp.", "The most common symptom of alopecia areata is patchy hair loss. A person may develop bald spots, which can occur on any part of the body. These bald spots usually appear suddenly and are smooth in appearance. In some cases, the hair will grow back after a few months or years, but in other cases, the hair loss will be permanent. Other symptoms include thinning hair and hair loss in the beard, eyebrows and eyelashes.", "Alopecia areata is diagnosed by a medical professional who can determine the cause of hair loss and whether it is temporary or permanent. A dermatologist will typically examine the patient's scalp, as well as any other affected areas. The doctor may also take a skin biopsy to rule out other conditions that could be causing the hair loss, such as autoimmune disease, fungal infection or even cancer.", "The most common treatment for alopecia areata is corticosteroid injections. A dermatologist may also recommend a topical steroid, oral immunosuppressants, light therapy, phototherapy or hair transplant surgery.", "Alopecia areata is a condition that can affect anyone, but it's most common in people who have a family history of the disease. A person may also be more likely to develop the condition if they have certain autoimmune diseases or if they're taking medications that suppress the immune system.", "There is no cure for alopecia areata, but it is possible to slow down hair loss. A dermatologist may prescribe topical or oral corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and stimulate hair growth. Topical minoxidil (Rogaine) can also be used to help regrow hair. If these treatments do not work, a person's doctor may suggest other treatment options, such as injections of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.", "Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidneys slowly lose their function over time, causing them to become less able to filter blood and remove waste products from the body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, there are often no symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, itching, swelling, confusion and shortness of breath. People who have chronic kidney disease may also develop anemia, high blood pressure, bone disease, depression, and heart disease.", "Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed with a medical history and physical exam, blood tests, imaging studies, urine tests and biopsy. A medical history includes questions about the patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, swelling in the legs, changes in urination and appetite loss. A physical exam will include an assessment of the heart and lungs, as well as checking for fluid in the abdomen or legs. Blood tests are used to measure kidney function. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, can help determine whether there is damage to the kidneys or other problems, such as a blockage in the urinary tract. Urine tests can check for protein in the urine, which may be a sign of kidney damage. A kidney biopsy is performed by taking a small sample of kidney tissue and looking at it under a microscope to see if there are signs", "Chronic kidney disease is a serious condition in which the kidneys slowly lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood and remove them from the body. In the early stages, there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease progresses, it can lead to swelling in the feet, ankles and legs; nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite; fatigue; high blood pressure; and weakness. The only treatment for chronic kidney disease is dialysis, which replaces the function of the kidneys by removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood.", "Chronic kidney disease is the slow loss of kidney function over a period of months or years. In most cases, this condition occurs as a result of high blood pressure and diabetes, which are both major risk factors for developing kidney disease. Other risk factors include: age, race, family history, sex and certain medical conditions such as glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease and some autoimmune diseases.", "Chronic kidney disease is a slow and progressive deterioration of the kidneys, which results in the gradual loss of their ability to filter wastes and excess fluids from the blood. In the early stages of the disease, the kidneys may be able to filter wastes normally, but over time they gradually become less effective. As the disease progresses, the kidneys may begin to produce urine that contains high levels of protein and waste products, and patients may experience symptoms such as fatigue, swelling and shortness of breath. The most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease is end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. Patients with ESRD will require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.", "Chronic kidney disease is a serious condition that affects millions of people every year. In fact, it is estimated that 1 in 9 Americans will have CKD by the time they are 60 years old. If you have been diagnosed with this condition, you may be wondering how you can slow down its progression. The good news is that there are several things you can do to help slow down the progression of CKD.", "Pellagra is a condition that occurs when a person doesn't get enough vitamin B3, which is also known as niacin. In addition to niacin deficiency, there are three other conditions that can cause pellagra: diabetes, liver disease and alcoholism. The most common symptoms of pellagra include skin rashes, diarrhea and dementia. There may be other symptoms depending on the cause, such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin), anemia and mouth ulcers.", "Pellagra is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Niacin is found in foods such as chicken, fish, meat, peanuts, pork and beef liver. The body needs niacin to produce certain enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. When a person doesn't get enough niacin in their diet, they can develop the symptoms of pellagra, including: Diarrhea Dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) Fatigue Headache Insomnia Irritability Jaundice Loss of appetite Mouth sores Muscle aches and weakness Nausea and vomiting Neurologic changes (including dementia, mental confusion and seizures) Red or brown discoloration of the skin Sore mouth", "Pellagra can be treated with niacin, which is a form of vitamin B3. A person should take 15 to 20 milligrams (mg) of niacin per day for six months to one year. The person should start with the lowest dose and increase it gradually over time to prevent side effects such as flushing and diarrhea.", "Pellagra is a condition that occurs when the body doesn't have enough vitamin B3, which is also known as niacin. A lack of niacin can lead to diarrhea, dermatitis and dementia. The best way to prevent pellagra is by eating foods that are rich in niacin, such as fish, beans, peanuts and meats. People who do not get enough niacin through their diet may need to take a supplement to make sure they get enough of this important nutrient.", "Pellagra is caused by a vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid or nicotinamide, is needed for the body to make energy and produce certain hormones.", "Pellagra can be a serious illness and, if left untreated, it can cause severe complications. In its early stages, pellagra causes skin inflammation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are similar to other conditions, such as stomach flu, food poisoning, or even the common cold. If left untreated, the disease progresses to neurological problems, including confusion, dementia, seizures, and paralysis.", "Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted and often painful veins. The most common location for varicose veins is the legs, but they can also occur in the thighs, pelvis, ankles and feet. Varicose veins are caused by a weakening of the valves within the vein, which allows blood to flow backward into the vein instead of up toward the heart. This results in increased pressure within the vein, causing it to swell and become more visible through the skin.", "Varicose veins can be diagnosed during a physical exam by a medical professional. A doctor will feel the veins to determine if they are enlarged or twisted and may ask the patient to stand up so that he or she can observe the veins in a different position. An ultrasound is the most accurate way to diagnose varicose veins, because it shows the location of the veins and the extent of their disease. The doctor may also order an x-ray or blood test to rule out other conditions.", "Varicose veins can cause a variety of symptoms. A person with varicose veins may experience aching, itching or burning in the legs. These veins may also be visible through the skin and appear as swollen, twisted, raised or bulging veins. The most common areas for varicose veins to develop are the legs and feet, but they can also occur on the face and neck.", "Varicose veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical into the vein to cause it to collapse and disappear. Surgery is another option, but this is usually reserved for cases where other treatments have not worked.", "Varicose veins can be hereditary, so if your family members have them, you are more likely to get them as well. Risk factors for developing varicose veins include being overweight, pregnancy and standing or sitting for long periods of time. Women are more likely than men to develop varicose veins, and they are also more likely to develop them during pregnancy.", "Varicose veins are the most common venous disease and are often caused by increased pressure in the veins, which is a result of faulty valves that allow blood to flow backwards. A number of factors may contribute to this condition, including pregnancy, obesity and heredity. People with a family history of varicose veins are at higher risk for developing this condition.", "The most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) include bloating, breast tenderness and fatigue. PMS is often accompanied by mood swings, depression, irritability, anxiety, food cravings and headaches. These symptoms usually occur about seven to 10 days before a woman's period begins and can last up to two weeks after her period starts.", "PMS is diagnosed when the symptoms last for at least 7 days a month, and the symptoms are so severe that they interfere with daily activities. A medical professional may perform a pelvic examination to rule out other conditions that could be causing the symptoms, such as an ovarian cyst or endometriosis. Blood tests can also be used to check for thyroid disorders or hormonal imbalances, which can contribute to the symptoms of PMS.", "There are several treatments that can be used to alleviate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These include diet, exercise and lifestyle changes. PMS is usually treated with a combination of dietary changes, lifestyle changes, and medications. The goal of treatment is to help manage symptoms, improve quality of life and prevent recurrences.", "PMS is most common in women ages 25 to 45, but it can occur at any age. It is more likely to occur if you have a family history of the condition, if you are overweight or obese, if you smoke cigarettes, if you have high blood pressure or diabetes, and if you do not exercise regularly. Other risk factors include being under stress and taking certain medications, such as birth control pills, anti-depressants, antihistamines, antidepressants and beta blockers.", "PMS is a term that refers to symptoms that occur before a woman's menstrual period. A woman may experience mood changes, fatigue, bloating and breast tenderness. These symptoms usually improve within a few days of the start of her period, but can last up to two weeks.", "Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a combination of physical, emotional and behavioral changes that many women experience in the days before their period begins. The exact cause of PMS is unknown, but it may be related to hormonal changes that occur during a woman's menstrual cycle. The most common symptoms include breast tenderness, bloating, mood swings and fatigue. There are many things that can be done to help manage these symptoms. These include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and managing stress. Women should also avoid foods and drinks that contain caffeine, as this can make symptoms worse.
