supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Slowing down the blood flow can be caused by a clot in one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain (ischemic stroke) or by bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Symptoms of stroke vary depending on which part of the brain is affected and can include weakness, paralysis, numbness, problems with vision, speech and understanding, dizziness and trouble with balance and coordination. Early treatment is essential, as the longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for damage to brain tissue.", "Strokes are diagnosed through a variety of methods, depending on the type of stroke. A doctor may be able to make a diagnosis by asking about symptoms and conducting a neurological examination, which involves testing the patient's reflexes, sensory skills and muscle strength. An MRI or CT scan can also help diagnose strokes by showing damage to the brain caused by blood clots or bleeding in the brain.", "Stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Saving brain tissue immediately after a stroke is crucial to minimize permanent damage to the affected area. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked, while hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. The most common type of stroke is an ischemic stroke, which accounts for about 87 percent of all cases.", "Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, smoking, age and family history of stroke. Stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving the brain tissue of oxygen and food. The most common type of stroke is ischemic stroke, which is caused by a clot blocking an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures, is less common than ischemic stroke.", "Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 87 percent of all cases. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off or reduced, causing brain cells to die.
