These tests help determine the location, size and stage of the tumor. In addition, a biopsy may be used to confirm the presence of cancer cells. If the doctor suspects cirrhosis, a liver biopsy may be done to look at the liver under a microscope. Other tests that may be ordered include alpha-fetoprotein test, AFP, to check for high levels of this protein in the blood; CA 19-9, a blood test that measures the level of a substance produced by some pancreatic cancers; and LDH, a blood test that measures the amount of lactic dehydrogenase, an enzyme found in many normal body tissues.", "Liver cancer is treated based on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumors and the overall health of the patient. In some cases, surgery may be used to remove part of the liver or the entire organ. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are sometimes used to kill cancer cells. Targeted therapies are drugs that target specific proteins found on the surface of cancer cells. These drugs work better than chemotherapy alone because they only affect cancer cells and not normal cells.", "Liver cancer can affect many aspects of a person's health, including physical appearance, mental state and quality of life. In addition to causing fatigue, nausea and vomiting, liver cancer can also cause jaundice, weight loss, swelling of the legs and feet, and yellowish discoloration of the eyes. It can also cause changes in mental status, such as confusion, forgetfulness and depression. These effects can make it difficult for individuals to perform daily activities.", "Risk factors for liver cancer include cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C, obesity, alcoholism, smoking and exposure to certain chemicals such as aflatoxins.

Some of these reasons include Graves' disease, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's disease, pregnancy, iodine deficiency, certain medications and cancer. In some cases, no reason can be found. If the goitre is large enough, it can press on nearby structures such as the trachea, esophagus, larynx or oesophagus, causing breathing problems, choking, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing and/or voice changes. Other possible symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, muscle weakness, irregular menstrual periods, hair loss, dry skin, constipation, increased sweating, palpitations, anxiety, depression, irritability, tremors, heat intolerance, sleep disturbances, vision changes, head", "Goitres are diagnosed based on physical examination findings and imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scan. If the thyroid nodule is large enough, it can be felt during a physical examination. Ultrasound is used to determine the size of the thyroid nodule and its location within the thyroid gland. It can also help identify any suspicious features that might suggest cancer. In some cases, a fine needle aspiration biopsy is done to obtain cells from the thyroid nodule. These cells are sent to a pathologist for evaluation under a microscope.", "Goiters are benign enlargements of the thyroid gland. Most cases of goiter are due to iodine deficiency, although some cases are idiopathic (of unknown origin). In these cases, the underlying cause is not known. If the goiter is large enough, it can compress surrounding structures such as the trachea, esophagus, larynx and recurrent laryngeal nerve. These compression effects can result in hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath and even airway obstruction. Fortunately, many cases of goiter respond very well to simple measures such as increasing iodine intake. Other treatments include radioactive iodine therapy, thyroid hormone replacement and surgery.", "Goitres are enlarged thyroid glands that can affect both men and women. In some cases, goitres are not harmful, but others can be cancerous. Most goitres are benign, meaning they are noncancerous. Benign goitres are generally harmless and don't need any treatment. If the goitre is large enough to interfere with breathing or swallowing, however, it may need to be removed.", "Goiters are enlarged thyroid glands, and while many cases are benign, others can be cancerous. Risk factors for developing a goiter include family history, radiation exposure, autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, and certain medications. Women who take estrogen therapy are at increased risk for developing a goiter.", "Goiters are benign enlargements of the thyroid gland. Most cases of goiter are due to iodine deficiency, although some cases are idiopathic (of unknown origin). In addition to eating a balanced diet rich in iodine, individuals with goiters should make certain lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of developing further problems. These include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and quitting smoking. If these measures fail to control the goiter, surgery may be necessary.", "Cardiomyopathy is a weakening of the heart muscle that makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. It can affect both the right and left ventricles of the heart. In some cases, the heart muscle becomes enlarged and thickened, while in others, the muscle becomes thinner and weaker.

Medications such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids can also help manage pain. Injections into the joint space can provide temporary relief, and corticosteroid injections can decrease swelling and inflammation. Joint replacement surgery is reserved for individuals whose pain cannot be controlled with these other methods.", "Osteoarthritis is a progressive joint disease that causes cartilage breakdown and eventual bone erosion. It is the most common form of arthritis and occurs in about 27 million Americans. In addition to causing pain and stiffness, osteoarthritis can limit mobility and make performing daily activities difficult. Some individuals experience fatigue, depression and anxiety due to the chronic nature of the disease.", "Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis include age, obesity, joint injury, previous joint replacement surgery and family history. Other risk factors include gender, race and certain occupations. Women are at higher risk than men, and African Americans are at higher risk than Caucasians. Occupations such as construction workers, factory workers and those who work outdoors put individuals at greater risk because of repetitive stress injuries.", "Coping with osteoarthritis can be difficult because the pain associated with this condition can make daily activities challenging. Fortunately, there are many things individuals can do to help manage their symptoms. These include exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, using assistive devices such as canes or walkers, and practicing relaxation techniques. In addition, individuals should talk to their doctor about any concerns they have regarding their condition.", "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit a wide range of behaviors, so no single set of symptoms defines ASD. Some children show signs within the first few months of life, while others don't show any signs until 24 months or later. In general, children with ASD have difficulty communicating and forming relationships with others. They tend to repeat certain words or phrases (\"eegee,\" \"uh oh\") and resist changes in routines. They might line up toys or insist on wearing the same outfit every day. Many children with ASD engage in repetitive movements such as rocking or twirling. These behaviors can make social interactions difficult, and some children with ASD may not speak at all.", "Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder begins with a thorough physical examination and review of the child's developmental history. Parents and teachers are asked about any unusual behaviors or concerns. If the doctor suspects autism, additional tests may be ordered to rule out other possible problems. These tests may include hearing and vision screenings, blood tests, electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).", "There is no single treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because each person experiences ASD differently. Some children respond better to behavior therapy while others benefit from speech therapy. Many parents find that a combination of these approaches works best. Medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and stimulants may help control some of the behaviors associated with ASD. In addition, occupational therapy, physical therapy and sensory integration therapy may improve functioning in daily activities.", "Yes, autism spectrum disorder can occur at any age. It is estimated that 1 out of every 68 children born today will be diagnosed with ASD. In addition, boys are four times more likely than girls to develop ASD. While the exact cause of ASD is unknown, researchers believe that both genetic and environmental factors play a role.", "Researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. While no single gene has been identified as causing ASD, research suggests that certain genes increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. In addition, studies show that children born to older parents are at higher risk for having ASD than those whose mothers were younger. Other possible risk factors include exposure to chemicals such as thalidomide during pregnancy, premature birth, and maternal infections such as rubella, chickenpox and herpes simplex.", "Social skills training is a very important part of therapy for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. It helps teach these individuals how to interact appropriately with others. Parents and teachers can help improve social skills by teaching appropriate behaviors and reinforcing positive behavior. Children with ASD benefit greatly from learning about emotions and feelings, so parents and teachers should work together to create opportunities for the child to learn about his or her own feelings and those of others.", "Acne occurs when hair follicles under the skin become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. Hormones play a role in causing acne, especially during puberty. Other factors that contribute to acne include stress, poor hygiene, certain cosmetics, greasy foods, chocolate, soda pop, milk products and some medications.", "Acne is a very common problem among teenagers and young adults. It occurs when oil and dead skin cells plug up hair follicles, causing whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Although many cases of acne clear up without treatment, some individuals need help managing their acne. In these cases, topical creams containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid are effective at reducing the number of lesions. Oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines and erythromycin are also helpful in treating acne. If these measures fail, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications, such as retinoids or isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is a powerful drug that works by shrinking sebaceous glands, thereby decreasing the amount of oil produced by the skin.", "Acne is classified into four main categories based on its location on the body: facial, chest, back and neck. Facial acne occurs on the face and is the most common type of acne. Chest acne appears on the upper chest and shoulders. Back acne affects the lower back and sometimes the upper back. Neck acne occurs on the neck and jawline. Each type of acne has its own characteristics and treatment plan.", "Acne is a chronic disorder that occurs when oil and dead skin cells clog pores. Hormones play a role in causing acne, so certain hormonal changes during puberty can trigger breakouts. Dietary factors such as dairy products, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter, eggs, shellfish, wheat, corn, citrus fruits, tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes, bananas, avocados, raspberries, blueberries, cherries, plums, prunes, raisins, figs, dates, coconut, coffee, tea, cola drinks, alcohol, sugar, processed meats, refined grains and trans fatty acids can all contribute to acne. Some studies suggest that eating too much protein can increase sebum production, while others show that high levels of zinc intake can reduce acne.", "Hygiene plays a large role in acne because it helps keep pores clean and prevents excess oil production. Acne occurs when dead skin cells and oils combine inside the hair follicles of the skin. When these substances mix together, they create a plug that blocks the opening of the follicle. Bacteria grow within the plugged follicle, causing redness, swelling and irritation. Washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser and using a noncomedogenic moisturizer can help reduce breakouts.", "Acne is a very common problem among teenagers and young adults. It occurs when oil and dead skin cells plug up hair follicles, causing whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Although acne is not harmful, it can leave scars and discolored patches on the face, chest and back. In some cases, acne can lead to permanent damage to the skin. Scarring can result from picking at lesions, using harsh topical products or having too many procedures done to remove acne. Permanent dark spots can develop due to excessive sun exposure while trying to cover up acne.", "The main symptom of sickle cell disease is chronic anemia, which occurs because red blood cells don't live long enough due to the shape of the cells. These cells tend to stick together and block blood flow, causing damage to organs throughout the body. Other symptoms include episodes of pain, fatigue, swelling of hands and feet, frequent infections and delayed growth.", "Diagnosis of sickle cell disease begins with a complete medical history and physical examination. During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of anemia, such as pale skin, fatigue and shortness of breath. Your doctor will also check for evidence of organ damage, such as swelling in the hands and feet, eye problems, hearing loss and delayed growth. In addition, your doctor may perform tests to determine the number of red blood cells in your body, the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell and the shape of your red blood cells. These tests help confirm a diagnosis of sickle cell disease.", "Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder that affects red blood cells. It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the gene that codes for the protein hemoglobin S, instead of just one copy. Inheriting only one copy of the gene results in sickle cell trait, which is not harmful. When both copies of the gene code for hemoglobin S, the body produces abnormal red blood cells that are crescent shaped rather than round. These abnormal cells die early, causing a shortage of red blood cells. As a result, individuals with sickle cell disease experience chronic anemia, fatigue, episodes of pain and organ damage.", "Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder that affects red blood cells. It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the gene that codes for the protein hemoglobin S, instead of just one copy. In normal red blood cells, hemoglobin helps carry oxygen throughout the body. But in those with sickle cell disease, the shape of the red blood cells changes into a crescent moon shape. These misshapen cells die early, causing a shortage of red blood cells. As a result, less oxygen reaches the body's organs and tissues, which can lead to organ damage and chronic pain.", "Inherited diseases such as sickle cell disease are passed down from parents to children through genetic traits. If both parents carry the gene for sickle cell disease, each child has a 25 percent chance of being born with the disease. If only one parent carries the gene, the child has a 50 percent chance of having the disease. If neither parent carries the gene, the child cannot inherit the disease.", "Managing the symptoms of sickle cell disease depends on what stage of the disease the person is in. In the early stages, individuals may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling and frequent infections. These symptoms can be managed with rest, fluids, oxygen therapy and medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. As the disease progresses, individuals may develop chronic pain, vision problems, ulcers and damage to internal organs. Pain management is key at this point, and many people find relief with opioid analgesics. Other treatments include hydroxyurea, transfusions and iron chelators.", "Common symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pelvic pressure, difficulty eating, frequent urination, fatigue, constipation, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, back pain, pain during intercourse, vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual periods, infertility, weight gain, swelling of the legs, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, dizziness, numbness, weakness, vision changes, hearing changes, dry mouth, sores in the mouth, hair loss, rash, itching, hives, acne, dark patches on the skin, change in bowel habits, rectal bleeding, and/or change in bladder habits.", "Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those of less serious conditions. In fact, many women don't experience any symptoms until the cancer has progressed significantly. When symptoms do appear, they may include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, frequent urination, constipation or diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, back pain, shortness of breath, swelling in the legs or feet, changes in bowel habits, vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual periods, infertility, weight gain or loss, and breast tenderness. If these symptoms persist, a woman should see her doctor right away.", "Treatment options for ovarian cancer depend on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. In general, early-stage ovarian cancer is treated with surgery alone, while advanced-stage ovarian cancer is treated with surgery plus chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs used to treat ovarian cancer include platinum agents such as cisplatin and taxanes such as paclitaxel. These drugs work by killing rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells. Other chemotherapy drugs used to treat ovarian cancer include gemcitabine, topotecan and liposomal doxorubicin.", "Ovarian cancer occurs when cells in the ovary grow out of control and form tumors. These tumors can interfere with normal functioning of the ovary and surrounding organs. In some cases, these tumors can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver and intestines. Ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. Common signs and symptoms include bloating, pelvic pain, difficulty eating, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor about possible causes.", "Risk factors for ovarian cancer include age, family history, obesity, infertility, hormone replacement therapy, smoking and certain reproductive factors such as never having children or giving birth at an older age. Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer or endometrial cancer are also at higher risk for developing ovarian cancer.", "Preventative measures for ovarian cancer include having children early in life, using birth control pills and undergoing fertility treatments. Women who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family should consider genetic testing to see if they carry the BRCA gene mutation. If so, they may want to consider prophylactic surgeries such as hysterectomies and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies. These procedures remove the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus, thereby reducing the risk of developing ovarian cancer.", "Influenza is characterized by fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, fatigue and sore throat. Some individuals may experience vomiting and/or diarrhea. These symptoms generally last about five days. Complications associated with influenza include sinus problems, ear infections, bronchitis and pneumonia. It is important to note that some people may not show any signs of having the flu, while others may develop very high temperatures and feel extremely sick.", "Influenza is spread through droplets produced when infected individuals sneeze or cough. These droplets contain the flu virus and can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby. It can also be spread through direct contact with an infected person. Those who come into contact with these droplets or objects that have been touched by an infected person are at risk of contracting the flu.", "Influenza is typically treated with rest, fluids and fever reducers. Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu can shorten the duration of the illness, but these must be started within 48 hours of the first signs of illness. If your doctor prescribes antivirals, make sure to take all doses as directed. It is important to note that antivirals only work if taken early enough in the course of the illness.", "Influenza vaccines come in many forms, including shots, nasal sprays and intradermal needles. Shots are given into muscle, while nasal sprays are administered up the nose. Intradermal needles are used to inject the vaccine just under the skin. All flu vaccines contain dead viruses, so they cannot give you the flu. Flu vaccines protect against three strains of influenza each year. These strains change every year because the virus mutates rapidly. It takes about two weeks for your body to develop immunity to the flu after receiving the vaccine.", "Influenza is a respiratory illness that affects millions of Americans each year. It is especially dangerous for those who are very young or old, pregnant women, individuals with chronic diseases such as asthma, COPD or heart disease, and those with weakened immune systems due to cancer or HIV/AIDS. These groups are at higher risk for developing complications from the flu, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections.", "Influenza is highly contagious and can be spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can also be spread through direct contact with these droplets or by touching objects or surfaces that have been contaminated with flu germs and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. To help prevent the spread of influenza, wash hands frequently, cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoid sharing utensils or drinking glasses. If you suspect you have contracted influenza, stay home until at least 24 hours after your fever subsides without the use of fever-reducing medications.", "Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland. It is classified into four categories based on its cause: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis and occurs suddenly. Common symptoms include fever, chills, burning during urination, frequent urination, lower back pain and discomfort while having sex. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is less common than acute bacterial prostatitis and develops slowly over time. Symptoms include similar ones to those of acute bacterial prostatitis, along with painful ejaculation, difficulty starting urination and pain in the testicles.", "Prostatitis is diagnosed based on a physical examination and a discussion about your symptoms. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, such as when they started, what makes them better or worse, and any associated symptoms, such as fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. You may need additional tests to rule out other problems, such as a urinalysis, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI.", "Prostatitis is diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination findings. If no specific cause is found, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of recurrence. In some cases, the doctor may perform a biopsy to rule out cancer. Other treatments include alpha blockers, antihistamines, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, muscle relaxants, narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and topical creams.", "Prostatitis is not considered a chronic condition because it generally resolves within six weeks. However, some cases of acute prostatitis can last longer than six weeks. In these cases, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help clear up the infection. If the infection doesn't go away, the doctor may perform a biopsy to determine what kind of prostate problem the patient has.", "Prostatitis affects men between 20 and 50 years old. It is rare in men younger than 18 and older than 60. Men who have had sexually transmitted diseases are at higher risk for developing prostatitis.", "Prostatitis is not related to lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption or sexual activity. It is important to note that some cases of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) may be associated with certain behaviors, such as frequent ejaculation, anal sex or prolonged sitting. These activities may irritate the prostate and contribute to CP/CPPS.", "Mumps is characterized by swelling of the salivary glands underneath the ears. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. In some cases, menstruating women may experience breast tenderness. Most individuals recover within 10 days without any lasting effects. However, about 25 percent of those infected develop complications such as deafness, orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) and oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries). These complications are rare and generally only affect adult males.", "Mumps is transmitted through saliva, so it is easily passed from person to person via sneezing, coughing or kissing. It is not possible to contract mumps from eating utensils, drinking glasses or door handles. In addition, mumps cannot be transmitted through breast milk or semen.", "Mumps is a viral infection that affects the salivary glands. It is characterized by swelling of the cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. Complications of mumps include meningitis, encephalitis, deafness and orchitis. Meningitis occurs when the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain become infected. Encephalitis is an infection of the brain itself. Deafness is due to damage to the cochlea, the part of the inner ear responsible for hearing. Orchitis is an infection of the testicles. In rare cases, pregnant women who contract mumps during the first trimester of pregnancy risk miscarriage or stillbirth.", "Mumps is a viral infection that is highly contagious and can be spread through saliva or mucus. It is important to note that mumps cannot be spread through casual contact such as shaking hands or hugging. In addition, individuals who have been vaccinated against mumps are still at risk of contracting the disease because immunity only lasts about 10 years. To protect yourself from mumps, make sure your child receives the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. If you think you might have mumps, call your doctor immediately so that you can receive proper treatment.", "Mumps is a viral infection that affects the salivary glands. It is characterized by swelling of the cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. Most cases of mumps resolve without any specific treatment.

If the mumps involve the testicles, the doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications to reduce the risk of infertility.", "Mumps is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms reported by the patient. It is important to note that some individuals infected with mumps may not show any symptoms at all. In addition, many cases of mumps go undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of other viral infections. If a person suspects that they have been exposed to mumps, they should see a doctor immediately. Testing for mumps is done using a sample of saliva or spinal fluid.", "Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by both psychotic features and depression or mania. Psychotic features include hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders and disorganized speech. Depressive episodes can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, guilt and suicidal thoughts. Manic episodes can include increased energy, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, grandiose ideas and impulsivity. These symptoms can fluctuate between periods of normal functioning and periods of psychosis.", "Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder begins with a thorough physical examination and review of the patient's medical history. In addition, mental status testing may be conducted to assess cognitive functioning. Mental status testing may involve asking questions about current events, memory, speech patterns and thought processes. If these tests suggest schizoaffective disorder, additional psychological evaluations may be ordered to determine the presence of hallucinations and delusions. These evaluations may include interviews with family members and friends, as well as observation of behavior during interactions with others.", "Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition characterized by psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions along with depression and/or mania. It is important to note that not all individuals with schizoaffective disorder experience both psychosis and mood episodes, so some people only experience one or the other.

If the hives are due to an allergic reaction, antihistamines are used to reduce the swelling and itching. In some cases, corticosteroids are prescribed to help control the immune system response. If the hives are due to an infection, antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria causing the problem. Sometimes, steroids are used to reduce the body's inflammatory response.", "Stress can trigger hives in some individuals. Hives are raised, red welts that appear on the skin due to allergic reactions. These welts can last anywhere from minutes to days. While many factors can contribute to hives, such as heat, cold, sunlight, pressure, insect bites, certain foods and medications, stress is another possible factor. In fact, research shows that 20 percent of people who experience hives report that stress was a contributing factor.", "Hives can last anywhere from minutes to days. In some cases, they may even persist for weeks. It depends on what triggers the reaction and how quickly the body responds to the trigger. Some individuals experience hives only once, while others may have recurring episodes. If hives last longer than 24 hours, it is important to seek medical attention because it could indicate a more serious underlying problem.", "Hives are not only extremely uncomfortable, but they can also be very scary. Fortunately, there are many things that individuals can do to reduce the risk of developing hives. First, make sure to eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. Second, try to limit your intake of processed foods and sugar. Third, drink plenty of water throughout the day. Fourth, avoid stressful situations whenever possible. Fifth, wear loose-fitting clothes made out of natural fabrics such as cotton. Finally, take frequent breaks during long periods of sitting or standing.", "Dengue fever is characterized by high fevers, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue. These symptoms generally last about 10 days. In some cases, dengue fever can progress into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal. It is important to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms develop.", "Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquito bites. Mosquitoes pick up the dengue virus from infected humans and then transmit it to others when they bite. Infected mosquitoes can pass the virus to humans within 24 hours of being infected. Once a person becomes infected, the virus remains in his or her body for about four weeks. During this time, the person is not able to transmit the virus to others. After the initial four weeks, however, the virus can still be found in the bloodstream, but the person cannot transmit the virus to others.", "There is no specific treatment for dengue fever, so the goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of developing severe complications. Patients should drink plenty of fluids to help keep themselves hydrated. Pain relief medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help ease muscle aches and headaches. Aspirin should not be used because it increases the risk of bleeding. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to manage dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.", "Prevention of dengue fever begins with reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus live near humans and breed in standing water. Therefore, eliminating sources of standing water around your home is important. In addition, wearing long sleeves and pants at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active, can help reduce exposure. Using insect repellent containing DEET is also helpful. If you must spend time outdoors, make sure to wear protective clothing and apply insect repellent.", "Complications associated with dengue fever include hemorrhaging, shock, respiratory distress, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and death. In some cases, individuals may experience recurrences of the disease months or years later.", "Recovery times vary greatly among individuals, but generally range between 2 weeks and 6 months. Some people recover within days, while others take much longer. In some cases, dengue fever can progress into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal. If you suspect you have dengue fever, seek immediate medical attention.", "Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects connective tissues throughout the body. It causes hardening of the skin and internal organs. In addition to causing changes in the skin, scleroderma can also affect the lungs, esophagus, kidneys, heart, muscles and joints. Some individuals experience only minor symptoms while others develop significant problems. Common signs and symptoms of scleroderma include thickened patches of skin, tightening of the skin, swelling of the fingers and toes, ulcers in the mouth, acid reflux, difficulty breathing, fatigue, Raynaud's phenomenon (a condition that causes numbness and color changes in the hands and feet) and calcinosis (small calcium deposits under the skin).", "Diagnosis of scleroderma begins with a thorough physical examination and review of your medical history. Your doctor will ask about any family members who have had similar problems. You may need additional tests such as X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans, MRI scans, lung function tests, eye exams and blood tests. These tests help determine what organs are involved and how much damage has occurred.", "There is no cure for scleroderma, but there are many treatments available to help manage its symptoms. These include topical creams, ointments and lotions; systemic therapies such as immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and biologics; physical therapy; and lifestyle changes. Physicians will work closely with each patient to determine what combination of these treatments works best for him or her.", "Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes hardening of the skin and internal organs. It occurs when the immune system attacks the connective tissues underneath the skin. In addition to causing changes in the skin, scleroderma can affect many parts of the body, including the lungs, esophagus, heart, kidneys, liver, intestines and muscles. Some individuals experience only minor problems while others develop significant organ damage.", "Risk factors for developing scleroderma include being female, having a family history of the disease, smoking and exposure to silica dust. It is important to note that not everyone with these risk factors develops scleroderma. In addition, many individuals with scleroderma do not have any known risk factors.", "Managing scleroderma symptoms depends on the specific type of scleroderma a person has. Some forms of scleroderma affect only the skin, while others involve internal organs such as the lungs, esophagus and heart. Internal organ involvement can make managing scleroderma difficult because many of these organs need to work together to function properly. It is important to see a doctor regularly so that any problems can be caught early and managed appropriately.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is characterized by weakness and muscle wasting in the legs and arms. It can affect any part of the body, but the face and eyes are not typically involved. Other symptoms include difficulty walking, fatigue, numbness and tingling. In some cases, individuals experience changes in sensation, such as increased sensitivity to light touch or sound. Some people develop respiratory problems, while others experience nausea and vomiting.", "Diagnosis of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome begins with a thorough physical examination and neurological evaluation. In addition, your doctor may perform tests such as electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) to help confirm the diagnosis. These tests measure the speed at which signals travel along nerves and muscles. Your doctor may also request a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to test spinal fluid for signs of inflammation.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. It affects about 1 person per 100,000 each year. The exact cause of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is unknown, although researchers believe it is triggered by a viral infection. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease and its severity. In some cases, no treatment is necessary because the disease runs its course without causing any long-term problems. Other times, intensive therapy is required to help manage the symptoms.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. In some cases, the nerves in the spinal cord may also be attacked. When this happens, the person experiences weakness, numbness and sometimes paralysis. These symptoms tend to start at the feet and legs and work their way upward. Most people recover within six months, although some experience long-term problems such as muscle weakness and fatigue.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, causing muscle weakness and sometimes even paralysis. It occurs when the body's immune system attacks the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. While the exact cause of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is unknown, certain viruses such as Zika, Epstein\u2013Barr, West Nile and influenza have been linked to the development of the condition. Other possible triggers include pregnancy, cancer, trauma and vaccination.", "Lifestyle changes can help reduce some of the symptoms associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. These include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and psychological counseling. Physical therapy helps improve muscle strength and coordination, while occupational therapy focuses on improving daily activities such as dressing and bathing. Speech therapy can help individuals regain their ability to speak clearly. Psychological counseling can help individuals cope with the emotional stress of having Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.", "Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. It is caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. In some cases, the tumor is not cancerous, but in others, it is. The excess production of growth hormone results in enlargement of the hands, feet, face and jaw. Other signs and symptoms include headaches, vision problems, joint pain, fatigue, impotence and insulin resistance.", "Acromegaly is a rare disorder that occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. It affects about 10 out of every million people worldwide. In addition to causing physical changes, acromegaly can also increase the risk of developing certain diseases such as cancer, heart problems and diabetes. Some of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly include enlargement of the hands and feet, thickened facial features, increased sweating, headaches, joint pain, vision problems, fatigue, impotence and insomnia.", "Acromegaly is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, along with lab tests and imaging studies. Signs and symptoms of acromegaly include enlargement of the hands and feet, thickened facial features, increased sweating, headaches, fatigue, joint aches and stiffness, vision problems, impotence, and high blood pressure. Lab tests used to diagnose acromegaly include insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, GH receptor mutation analysis, and MRI scans of the pituitary gland. Imaging studies such as CT scan and ultrasound of the thyroid and adrenal glands are also helpful.", "Acromegaly is a rare disorder that occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. It affects about 10 out of every million people worldwide. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy and drug therapy. In some cases, all three methods are used together. Surgery is the preferred method because it offers the best chance at remission. Radiation therapy is used to shrink tumors that cannot be removed surgically. Drug therapy is used to control excess production of growth hormone.", "Acromegaly can result in many complications, such as joint problems, high blood pressure, enlarged organs, vision problems, headaches, fatigue, impotence and insulin resistance. It can also increase the risk of developing certain cancers, especially colon cancer. In addition, some individuals develop a benign tumor known as a pituitary macroadenoma, which can press on the optic nerve and cause visual field defects.", "Acromegaly is a rare disorder that occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. It affects about 10 out of every million people worldwide. In some cases, the excess growth hormone production is due to a tumor in the pituitary gland. If the tumor is removed, the person's symptoms will improve. However, even without a tumor, the condition can still progress slowly over time. Progression of the disease can be slowed down by using medications such as octreotide, lanreotide and somatostatin analogs. These drugs help reduce the amount of growth hormone produced by the pituitary gland.", "Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on a physical examination and testing of a sample of vaginal discharge. During a pelvic exam, your doctor will look at the color and consistency of your vaginal discharge. If your discharge looks cloudy, white or gray, or if it smells bad, you may have bacterial vaginosis. Your doctor may take a sample of your vaginal discharge and send it to a lab for further testing.", "Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina. It is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although sexual activity increases the risk of developing it. Common symptoms include increased discharge, odor, burning during urination and irritation. Some women experience no symptoms at all. If left untreated, bacterial vaginosis can increase the risk of preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease.", "Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. It is important to take all of the prescribed medicine even if your symptoms go away within a few days. If you stop taking the medicine too soon, the infection could return. You should not have sex until your symptoms are gone and you finish the full course of antibiotics.", "Bacterial vaginosis occurs when certain bacteria grow out of control in the vagina. It is not clear what causes these bacteria to multiply, but some factors that increase your risk of developing bacterial vaginosis include having multiple sex partners, douching, using spermicides, being pregnant, and having recently given birth.", "Bacterial vaginosis is a very common condition that affects women of all ages. It is characterized by an increase in certain bacteria in the vagina, causing a change in the normal balance of bacteria found there. If left untreated, bacterial vaginosis can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm delivery, miscarriage and infertility. In addition, some studies suggest that bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of HIV transmission.", "Bacterial vaginosis cannot be prevented, but its symptoms can be managed. It is important to practice good hygiene habits, such as washing the vulva daily with soap and water and changing sanitary products frequently. Women should not douche because douching can actually increase the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis. If women experience any unusual discharge or odor, they should see their doctor right away.", "Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are episodes of disturbed electrical activity in the brain. These seizures can affect consciousness, movement, sensation, emotions and behavior. Someone having a seizure may experience any combination of these symptoms. In addition, some individuals may not lose consciousness during a seizure. During a seizure, muscles may contract involuntarily, causing stiffness or jerking movements. Sometimes, a person may fall down or lose control of his or her bowels or bladder. Other times, a person may simply sit still and appear confused. After a seizure, the person may feel tired or sleepy.", "Epilepsy is diagnosed based on a person's history of seizures and results of tests such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An EEG records electrical activity in the brain and helps determine what part of the brain is involved in the seizure. MRI uses radio waves and magnets to produce detailed images of the brain. These tests help identify any structural problems in the brain that could be causing the seizures. In some cases, additional testing may be necessary to rule out other possible causes of seizures.", "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects approximately 2 million Americans and occurs in all age groups. In some cases, epilepsy is temporary and resolves without any treatment. In others, however, it is chronic and lifelong. Fortunately, many effective treatments exist for epilepsy, including anti-seizure medications, vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and surgery. These treatments help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures, allowing individuals to live normal lives.", "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects approximately 2 million Americans and occurs when nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions or behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. While many factors contribute to the development of epilepsy, some of the most common triggers include fevers, alcohol withdrawal, sleep deprivation, stress, flashing lights, certain medications and head injuries.", "Lifestyle changes can play a big role in managing epilepsy. These include eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, maintaining good sleep habits and reducing stress. It is important to talk to your doctor about any new medications or herbal remedies you plan to take because some of these products can interact with seizure medications. Also, make sure to tell your doctor about any new activities you plan to try, such as driving or swimming.", "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects approximately 2 million Americans and occurs in all age groups. Although many people think of seizures as convulsions, not all seizures involve convulsions. Some seizures only involve staring spells or brief periods of confusion. Other seizures may result in strange sensations such as numbness, dizziness, nausea or fear. In some cases, seizures may even resemble psychiatric episodes. Many people with epilepsy live normal lives without any restrictions. However, others may need to limit certain activities due to the risk of having a seizure while performing those activities.", "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the lungs and chest wall. It can be caused by many things, such as lung diseases, cancer, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pregnancy, radiation therapy and trauma. In some cases, no underlying cause can be found. Pleural effusion can make breathing difficult and cause shortness of breath. If the fluid becomes infected, it can cause fever, chills and increased pain.", "Pleural effusion is diagnosed based on your signs and symptoms, physical examination and imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans and ultrasounds.

These fluids can accumulate due to various reasons, such as lung cancer, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, tuberculosis, trauma, radiation therapy and others. In some cases, the fluid collection resolves without any intervention. If the fluid collection persists despite conservative management, drainage of the fluid may be necessary. Drainage can be done using a needle inserted into the pleural space under ultrasound guidance. Sometimes, a thoracentesis is required to remove large amounts of fluid.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. Common symptoms include jaundice, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion, gas, bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Some individuals experience no symptoms at all until the cancer has progressed significantly. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect because it doesn't produce any specific signs or symptoms until it reaches advanced stages. In fact, many cases aren't discovered until the tumors have grown large enough to interfere with normal functioning of the pancreas. As a result, only about 10 percent of all pancreatic cancers are found at early stages. When pancreatic cancer is suspected, your doctor will perform tests such as CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine the location and stage of the cancer. If these tests show evidence of cancer, a biopsy will be done to confirm the diagnosis.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. Once diagnosed, however, treatment depends on the stage of the cancer. If caught early enough, surgery may be able to remove all or part of the tumor. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used to kill any remaining cancer cells. In some cases, chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. Other treatments include targeted drug therapies, immunotherapy and hormone therapy.", "The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces enzymes that help break down food into smaller molecules so that the body can absorb nutrients. It also produces insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in the pancreas grow out of control and form tumors. These tumors can interfere with the normal functions of the pancreas and surrounding organs.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those of less serious diseases. Some risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer, high levels of insulin in the blood, certain inherited gene mutations and exposure to certain chemicals.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early because its symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases.
