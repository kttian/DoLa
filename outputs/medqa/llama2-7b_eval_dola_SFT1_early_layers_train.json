The stages are based on glomerular filtration rate, which is the amount of blood filtered by the kidneys per minute. This number can be estimated through a simple blood test called creatinine clearance or measured directly using a specialized test called plasma creatinine clearance. The stages of CKD are as follows: Stage 1: Glomerular filtration rate is greater than 90 mL/minute and less than 60 mL/minute. Stage 2: Glomerular filtration rate is greater than 60 mL/minute and less than 30 mL/minute. Stage 3: Glomerular filtration rate is greater than 30 mL/minute and less than 15 mL/minute.
