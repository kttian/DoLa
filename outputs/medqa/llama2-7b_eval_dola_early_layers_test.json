to the stomach. When esophagitis occurs, the lining of the esophagus becomes irritated, resulting in painful swallowing. In addition, esophagitis can cause other problems such as difficulty swallowing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss. The exact cause of esophagitis varies depending on the person, but common causes include acid reflux, food allergies, medications, bacterial infections, viruses, radiation therapy and chemical exposure.", "Esophagitis, an inflammation of the esophagus, may be caused by acid reflux (GERD) or another type of stomach acid exposure. Symptoms include difficulty swallowing, chest pain and heartburn. In addition, there may be pain behind the breastbone and nausea. These symptoms may also be caused by gastritis, a condition in which the lining of the stomach becomes irritated and inflamed. The stomach produces acids and enzymes that break down food. When these acids are released into the esophagus, the tissues become irritated and inflamed, causing pain.", "Esophagitis is usually diagnosed with a physical exam, a medical history, and endoscopy, a procedure used to view the inside of the esophagus. If esophagitis is suspected, your doctor may also order tests such as X-rays, blood tests and cultures, and a biopsy. The type of esophagitis you have and how serious it is will determine what kind of treatment you need. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include antibiotics, antihistamines, stomach acid reducers, and steroids. In some cases, you may need a feeding tube temporarily until your esophagitis resolves.", "Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the esophagus. This condition can be caused by many things, such as acid reflux disease, radiation therapy, certain medications, and certain infections. It is also commonly associated with GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of esophagitis include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.", "Esophagitis can be treated in several ways. Antibiotics may be prescribed to help reduce the amount of bacteria that may be causing the esophagitis. If esophagitis is caused by an underlying medical condition, treating that condition will help relieve symptoms of esophagitis. If the esophagitis is severe, hospitalization may be necessary. In addition to antibiotics, patients may need to receive fluids, nutrients or oxygen through a vein. If the esophagitis is caused by stomach acid, the doctor may prescribe medication to help reduce the acid level.", "Esophagitis can be prevented by practicing good hygiene. Washing your hands frequently, especially before preparing food, is very important to help prevent this condition. Also, make sure to cook food thoroughly to kill germs. If you suffer from esophagitis, try to avoid foods and drinks that irritate your stomach and eat small meals throughout the day instead of three large ones.", "Dysentery is defined as an acute intestinal inflammation accompanied by bloody or mucoid stool. Symptoms of dysentery include fever, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. It is important to see a physician immediately if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.", "Dysentery, or severe diarrhea, is typically diagnosed based on the presence of blood and mucus in the stool and symptoms of fever, vomiting and abdominal pain. The patient's medical history is also taken into consideration, and a physical exam is conducted to check for signs of dehydration. To confirm the diagnosis, a health care professional may conduct a stool sample test to detect parasites, bacteria or viruses that may be causing the problem.", "Dysentery is a bacterial infection that affects the intestines, causing diarrhea. In cases where the diarrhea is bloody, it is referred to as dysentery. The main treatment for dysentery is to replace fluids lost due to vomiting and diarrhea. Antibiotics may be prescribed to fight off the infection. If an individual has signs of dehydration, such as extreme thirst, little or no urine production, weakness and fatigue, a doctor may administer intravenous fluids to restore fluid balance.", "Dysentery is a term used to describe inflammation of the intestines. The two main forms of dysentery are amoebic and bacillary. Amoebic dysentery is caused by an organism known as Entamoeba histolytica. It is spread through feces and contaminated food and water. Bacillary dysentery is caused by a bacterial infection. It is spread through feces and contaminated food and water.", "Dysentery is caused by bacteria that can enter the body through the mouth or intestines. It is most commonly contracted when traveling to developing countries, where sanitation and cleanliness standards may not be up to U.S. standards. Other risk factors for contracting dysentery include exposure to sewage or infected animals. Children under five and people with weakened immune systems are also at increased risk of developing the disease.", "Dysentery can be prevented by following a few simple steps, such as washing your hands with soap and clean, running water and avoiding eating undercooked meat or seafood. Another good tip is to avoid swallowing water when swimming in bodies of water. These tips will help prevent contracting dysentery from infected food or water. If you develop diarrhea while traveling, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. It is also important to wash your hands frequently, especially after using the restroom and before preparing food or eating.", "The symptoms of dementia will vary depending on the underlying cause. Some of the most common symptoms of dementia include memory problems, language difficulties, impaired judgment, disorientation and confusion, difficulty completing normal daily activities, and personality changes.", "Dementia can only be diagnosed after a person undergoes a thorough evaluation that includes a physical exam, neurological testing, blood tests, imaging studies and mental status tests. A doctor will ask about the person\u2019s medical history, family history and current symptoms. During the exam, a doctor will check for signs of dementia, such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, problems with language and impaired judgment. If these symptoms are found, a doctor may refer the patient to a psychiatrist, neurologist or geriatrician for further testing.", "Dementia is a general term used to describe the decline in cognitive function that occurs in many diseases. Common symptoms include memory loss, trouble thinking clearly, confusion and problems with language. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. The main treatment is to address behavioral changes with non-medicinal therapies such as psychotherapy, social activities, physical activity, music therapy and reminiscence therapy.", "Dementia is a chronic disease that affects the way a person thinks, acts and feels. It is not a specific disease, but rather a group of symptoms that result from a change in the brain. Symptoms include difficulty remembering recent events, trouble understanding and communicating, and changes in mood and behavior. Dementia can greatly impact a person's quality of life and ability to function independently. Daily activities such as eating, dressing, and bathing can become difficult or even impossible for those with dementia.", "Some risk factors for dementia include advancing age, family history of dementia, head injury, Down syndrome, and vascular conditions. It is not clear exactly why some people develop dementia while others do not, although researchers believe that the number and severity of risk factors play a role in developing dementia.", "Although dementia is a chronic condition, there are steps that individuals and their families can take to help manage the symptoms. First, people with dementia should try to keep up a daily routine as much as possible. They should continue to participate in activities they enjoy, even if they have to adapt those activities to meet the limitations of the disease. Second, they should maintain social contacts. This will help keep their mind active and provide emotional support. Third, it is important to find a balance between activity and rest. Too much rest can lead to depression and anxiety. Fourth, it is important to remember that everyone with dementia is different. It is important to find out what works best for each person, and then tailor a plan around that.", "The primary symptom of tonsillitis is throat pain and difficulty swallowing. Other symptoms may include headache, fever, bad breath, white spots on the tonsils, tender lymph nodes, sore throat, swollen tonsils, hoarseness, ear pain, cough, strep throat and difficulty opening the mouth. Tonsillitis is often caused by viruses, but it can also be caused by bacteria.", "Tonsillitis is typically diagnosed based on a physical examination of the throat and ears, as well as the patient's medical history and symptoms. Sometimes, a doctor may order tests to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The doctor will also consider the patient's age and any other relevant factors when diagnosing the cause of the illness.", "Treatment of tonsillitis depends on whether or not it is acute or chronic. Acute tonsillitis is usually treated with antibiotics, such as penicillin. If the infection does not respond to antibiotic therapy, surgery may be required. Chronic tonsillitis is treated with antibiotics and other medications. In some cases, surgery is required to remove the tonsils.", "Tonsillitis is the inflammation of the tonsils and is caused by viruses or bacteria. Some people with tonsillitis do not develop any symptoms at all. Others experience sore throat, fever, swollen neck lymph nodes, headache and tender spots on the sides and back of the neck. If tonsillitis is left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as strep throat, meningitis, abscesses, cellulitis and rheumatic fever.", "Tonsillitis is often caused by viruses and bacteria. Viral tonsillitis is more common than bacterial tonsillitis. Bacterial tonsillitis is caused by strep throat, and it is important to get this diagnosis because antibiotics are necessary to cure strep throat. Preventing tonsillitis can be difficult, but good hygiene habits are helpful. Washing your hands regularly and covering your mouth when you cough can help to reduce the spread of germs. You can also help prevent tonsillitis by getting the flu shot each year and avoiding crowds during peak flu season.", "Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils, which are located at the back of the throat. While this condition can be treated with over-the-counter medications, many individuals prefer home remedies that provide relief without the side effects that some medications cause.

In rare cases, cellulitis can be life-threatening, so it's important to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms develop.", "Cellulitis is diagnosed based on a physical examination and the patient's symptoms. In many cases, a doctor will be able to diagnose cellulitis simply by looking at a patient's skin. However, some cases may require lab tests to confirm the diagnosis. If cellulitis is suspected, the doctor will likely perform a physical examination and check for signs of swelling, tenderness and redness on the patient's skin.", "Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics and, sometimes, anti-inflammatory drugs. The specific antibiotic used will depend on the organism causing the infection and whether there is any risk of allergy or drug interaction. It is important to follow the prescribed treatment course, even if the symptoms seem to improve earlier than expected. Some cases of cellulitis may require hospitalization.", "Cellulitis spreads by entering the body through breaks in the skin, such as cuts or scrapes. Once the bacteria enter the body, it travels through the lymphatic system until it reaches the bloodstream. At that point, it can travel throughout the body and infect any organ or tissue. This can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the heart. If this happens, the person may experience difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and even shock.", "Cellulitis, a serious bacterial skin infection, is most likely to affect those who have a compromised immune system, poor circulation, or chronic skin problems. Diabetics are especially vulnerable, since elevated glucose levels can impair blood flow, causing damage to the nerves and blood vessels that protect against bacteria. Other risk factors include recent injury to the affected area, obesity, alcoholism, smoking and the use of corticosteroids. Cellulitis may also develop following a burn or surgical wound, as these areas may not heal normally.", "Cellulitis can be prevented through a few simple lifestyle changes, such as washing your hands often, avoiding scratching and picking at scabs or cuts, and using good hygiene techniques. You should also wear loose, breathable clothing, especially during hot weather. Keeping your body clean and dry can also help prevent cellulitis, as can wearing shoes and socks that fit properly. It is important to take precautions if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, as you are at increased risk of developing this infection.", "The symptoms of vasculitis will vary depending on the type of vasculitis. The most common symptom is joint pain, and some individuals experience fatigue, fever and weight loss. Other symptoms include rashes, purple spots on the skin, and ulcers in the mouth or nose. If the patient has severe symptoms, they may also have problems breathing or swallowing, and they may lose their vision or hearing.", "Doctors diagnose vasculitis through a combination of medical history, physical examination and lab tests. The first step is a thorough physical exam, during which your doctor will examine any rashes, sores or ulcers. Your doctor will also take a complete medical history, including a family history of vasculitis. Lab tests, such as a blood test called an ANCA, can confirm a vasculitis diagnosis. In addition, your doctor may perform imaging tests to look at your blood vessels and assess blood flow. Imaging tests may include X-ray, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, angiograms, biopsies, and electrocardiograms (ECG).", "Treatment depends on the type of vasculitis a person has and how severe it is. Most cases of vasculitis are treated with medications that suppress the immune system. These drugs are known as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and they work by reducing the activity of the immune system and limiting inflammation. Other medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may be prescribed for pain relief. In some cases, antibiotics may be used to treat an infection caused by vasculitis. If the disease affects the skin, topical creams may be applied. If the disease affects the joints, rest and physical therapy may be recommended. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected tissue or organs.", "There are many causes of vasculitis, including immune system disorders, infections and certain drugs. In some cases, the cause is unknown. The symptoms of vasculitis are caused by inflammation in the blood vessels and include fever, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, rash and muscle weakness.", "Vasculitis, an autoimmune disorder, can be serious and potentially fatal. It occurs when the immune system attacks the blood vessels. If the immune system damages too many blood vessels, it can affect organs throughout the body, causing organ damage and even death. Vasculitis can occur anywhere in the body. Common sites of involvement are the joints, skin, muscles and internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs, heart and nervous system. Complications of vasculitis include inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) that can damage organs and lead to tissue death, anemia (low red blood cell count) and low platelet counts, and in some cases, kidney failure.", "Lifestyle changes can be very helpful in managing vasculitis. Patients with vasculitis should eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake. Additionally, they should get adequate rest and manage stress levels. These lifestyle changes can help reduce inflammation and improve overall health, which can help manage symptoms of vasculitis.", "The symptoms of liver cancer depend on how advanced the cancer is. At its earliest stages, liver cancer may not cause any symptoms, while more advanced cases can cause jaundice, abdominal swelling and weight loss. If a tumor is large enough, it may also press against the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms may include dark urine, easy bruising, fatigue and weakness.", "Liver cancer is typically diagnosed by imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans and angiography. These tests help detect the tumor, its location and how far it has spread. The doctor may also order blood tests to check liver function and look for liver damage. Biopsies can also be done to confirm the diagnosis, and determine if the cancer has spread.", "Liver cancer can be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or surgery. If a person has liver cancer, his or her doctor will discuss treatment options with them. Treatment depends on the stage and location of the tumor, the size of the tumor, the patient's overall health and the patient's preference. Some people opt for chemotherapy or radiation therapy, while others choose surgery or a combination of these treatments.", "Liver cancer, also called hepatocellular carcinoma, is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. It is the fifth most common type of cancer in the world. In the U.S., 26,300 new cases are diagnosed each year. The main risk factors for developing liver cancer are cirrhosis of the liver, obesity, chronic hepatitis B or C and exposure to certain chemicals, such as vinyl chloride and thorium dioxide. In general, people with liver cancer tend to have a poor prognosis because of the late stage at which they are often diagnosed and because the cancer tends to recur.", "Although anyone can develop liver cancer, certain factors put individuals at higher risk. These risk factors include alcohol abuse, chronic infections such as hepatitis B and C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, cirrhosis and exposure to chemicals like aflatoxins. In addition, those who have inherited certain gene mutations or those with family members with liver cancer are at greater risk for the disease.", "Lifestyle changes that can help prevent or manage liver cancer include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, limiting alcohol intake and avoiding exposure to chemicals that could damage the liver. Additionally, eating a healthy diet that is low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables is important, as this can help protect the liver from damage. It is also important to get regular medical screenings for liver cancer, such as ultrasounds, CT scans or MRIs.", "The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough, but there may also be a slight fever, chest discomfort, headache and shortness of breath. Coughing may produce mucus. Acute bronchitis generally gets better within a few days without any special treatment. Antibiotics are not helpful in treating acute bronchitis, because most cases are due to viruses, which antibiotics cannot kill. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus and spread by coughing and sneezing.", "Bronchitis is usually diagnosed based on symptoms such as coughing and wheezing, along with a physical examination and a medical history. In some cases, a doctor may perform a chest X-ray to check for fluid or other changes in the lungs. If the condition persists, a doctor may conduct further testing to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as pneumonia.", "Bronchitis is typically treated with rest and self-care measures, such as drinking plenty of fluids, using a humidifier and taking over-the-counter medications to reduce fever and ease cough. If the condition becomes more severe, prescription medications may be recommended. These include steroids to reduce inflammation, and antibiotics to treat the underlying infection. In some cases, bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, so it's important to see a doctor if symptoms don't improve within a few days.", "Bronchitis occurs when the lining of the bronchial tubes (air passages) becomes irritated or infected. Bronchitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and chemicals. Viruses are the most common cause of acute bronchitis, but bacterial infections can also occur and account for about 5 percent of all cases. In rare cases, chronic bronchitis is caused by exposure to toxic fumes and chemicals.", "Risk factors for bronchitis include being exposed to cigarette smoke, having allergies, having asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), being around secondhand smoke, having a respiratory infection, living in a polluted environment and being over 65 years old.", "The best way to manage bronchitis symptoms is to make lifestyle changes that reduce your exposure to irritants and keep your airways clear. Some of these include quitting smoking, using a humidifier to add moisture to the air, and drinking plenty of fluids. You should also try to avoid dusty environments and allergens such as pollen, and take measures to reduce exposure to cigarette smoke. If you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe medications to help control your symptoms.", "Goitres are enlarged thyroid glands. Goitre is most commonly caused by a deficiency of iodine in the diet, and this is known as simple goitre. However, goitre may also be caused by Grave's disease or cancerous tumors of the thyroid. Symptoms of simple goitre include swelling of the neck and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of goitre may include hoarseness of voice, weight gain, and trouble swallowing.", "Goitres can be diagnosed by a physical examination or through imaging tests such as ultrasounds or x-rays. In some cases, a doctor may order a thyroid function test to help determine whether a goitre is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).", "Goiter is the medical term used to describe an enlarged thyroid gland, which can cause a noticeable swelling at the base of the neck. Treatment of a goiter depends on its cause. If the goiter is due to a noncancerous growth, the doctor may simply monitor it closely. However, if a goiter is caused by hyperthyroidism, treatment may involve radioactive iodine to shrink the gland. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove all or part of the thyroid gland.", "The development of a goitre is usually due to a hormonal imbalance in the body. The thyroid gland produces two important hormones, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. If these hormone levels are too high, this results in hyperthyroidism and the production of too many thyroid hormones. In this case, a goitre may develop. On the other hand, if the thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough hormones, a goitre will develop, resulting in hypothyroidism.", "Some risk factors for developing a goitre include thyroid nodules, excessive iodine consumption, family history and having a family member with a goitre, and autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis or Graves\u2019 disease. In addition, women are at higher risk than men because of their smaller size and higher levels of estrogen, which slows down thyroid hormone production. Other risk factors include having certain medical conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, as well as exposure to radiation therapy to the head or neck region.", "A goitre can be managed with diet and exercise changes, medication, surgery and iodine supplements. Lifestyle adjustments such as reducing the intake of salt can reduce the amount of thyroid hormone produced in the body. Reducing stress can also be beneficial, as high levels of stress can trigger an increase in thyroid hormone production. It is important to maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. In addition, it is recommended to participate in regular aerobic exercise.", "Cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick or stiff, and is unable to pump blood effectively. In some cases, the heart chambers stretch and thin, and the heart cannot relax properly between contractions. As a result, the heart can no longer pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. There are many different types of cardiomyopathy, each with its own set of signs and symptoms. Common types include dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and restrictive cardiomyopathy.", "Cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened or rigid, and therefore cannot pump blood effectively throughout the body. There are several types of cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic, dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs when the walls of the heart thicken, causing the heart to become stiff. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by the heart becoming enlarged and weakened. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle stiffens and cannot relax properly, so less blood can be pumped out of the heart.", "Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can affect all parts of the heart, but is often limited to one chamber. In some cases, cardiomyopathy causes the heart muscle to enlarge, but in others, it becomes rigid. Cardiomyopathy may occur suddenly, or develop over time. The signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy depend on the type of disease, and can include shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, swelling of the legs, and weight gain. Some patients have no symptoms at all.", "Cardiomyopathy is typically diagnosed after a thorough physical exam and review of the patient's medical history. A physician will perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. These tests can help to identify problems with the structure and function of the heart muscle. In some cases, an angiogram, which uses X-rays to show blood flow, is used to detect blockages in the heart. Other tests, such as cardiac catheterization, can be used to determine the amount of pressure being exerted by the heart muscle.", "Cardiomyopathy cannot be cured, but the symptoms can be treated with lifestyle changes and medication. Medication is used to help control arrhythmias and high blood pressure, while lifestyle changes can help manage weight and reduce stress. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to help improve the function of the heart.", "Lifestyle changes are important for people with cardiomyopathy. These individuals should focus on maintaining a healthy weight and limiting salt intake to help reduce strain on the heart. Exercise is also recommended for those with this condition, as it helps improve overall fitness and strengthen the heart muscle. Lastly, smoking cessation is strongly encouraged for people with cardiomyopathy, as this can improve overall health and decrease the risk of heart attack or stroke.", "Symptoms of osteoarthritis may include pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints. Osteoarthritis can occur in any joint in the body but most commonly affects the knees, hips, hands, spine and feet. It is important to see your doctor if you experience any joint pain or stiffness, especially if you have risk factors such as obesity or a family history of osteoarthritis.", "Osteoarthritis is diagnosed based on a person\u2019s medical history and physical examination, along with imaging tests such as X-rays. These tests help to determine if the joints have been affected by osteoarthritis and whether or not the cartilage between the bones has been worn away. Other tests that may be done include MRI scans, CT scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and joint aspiration. Joint aspiration involves withdrawing a sample of fluid from the joint. The fluid is then sent to a lab, where it is tested to look for signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormalities of the cartilage.", "Osteoarthritis is a condition that occurs when cartilage between joints breaks down, causing painful friction between bones. Treatments for osteoarthritis depend on the location and severity of the joint damage, and can include rest, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injections and surgery.", "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is most commonly found in the hands, hips, knees and spine.

Most cases are mild and result in no long-term complications, but severe cases of dengue fever can cause complications such as internal bleeding, organ failure, shock and death. There are four strains of dengue fever virus that can cause dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). These strains are classified into types I, II, III and IV, with types I and II being most common. DHF occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of all dengue fever cases and can be fatal if not properly treated.", "Most people who recover from dengue fever do so without any lasting effects. However, in some cases, the symptoms can linger for several weeks or even months. Some individuals may experience chronic fatigue, joint pain or muscle aches. In rare cases, dengue fever can cause a more severe complication known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by bleeding, shock, organ damage and death. The recovery time for this type of illness depends on the severity of the case.", "The symptoms of scleroderma can vary from person to person. The disease is classified into two forms, limited and diffuse, based on the degree of involvement of the body's internal organs. Limited scleroderma is characterized by skin thickening and hardening, along with the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's is a condition in which the fingers or toes turn white or blue upon exposure to cold temperatures. In diffuse scleroderma, skin thickening occurs throughout the body and is accompanied by other symptoms such as muscle weakness, joint stiffness, and difficulty swallowing. Other symptoms of diffuse scleroderma include shortness of breath and high blood pressure.", "The diagnosis of scleroderma is based on clinical signs and symptoms, as well as a thorough medical history. Medical professionals use a variety of tests to help confirm the diagnosis. These include x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, blood tests and biopsies. Blood tests can show high levels of calcium or iron. MRI scans may show thickening of the skin and/or enlargement of the blood vessels under the skin. Biopsies of the skin or internal organs can confirm the presence of scleroderma.", "Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease that is characterized by hardening of the skin and connective tissues. It is considered an autoimmune disease, as the body produces antibodies that attack its own cells and tissues. Although there is no cure for scleroderma, there are a number of treatments that can help manage the disease. These include medications to control the immune system, pain relievers to treat joint pain, and physical therapy.", "Scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that can cause thickening of the skin and the connective tissues throughout the body. It also can affect internal organs such as the esophagus, lungs and kidneys. This disorder is progressive and chronic, meaning that it tends to worsen over time.", "The primary risk factor for scleroderma is gender. It is more common in women than in men, though it is possible for men to develop this condition. Other risk factors include age, family history and race. Caucasians and Asian Americans are at higher risk of developing scleroderma than African Americans or Hispanics. Smoking also increases the risk of developing scleroderma, as do certain autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, and chronic graft versus host disease.", "Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects connective tissues in the body, causing thickening of the skin and other internal problems. The symptoms of this condition can range from mild to severe and may affect the face, hands, feet and other parts of the body. There are several things individuals with scleroderma can do to help manage the symptoms. These include exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and limiting exposure to cold temperatures. If the disease is causing joint stiffness and pain, individuals can apply heat or take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen to ease the pain.", "Symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome include weakness and tingling in the legs and arms, which spreads to the face and upper body. In some cases, the paralysis can affect the entire body, leaving the person unable to speak, eat or breathe. The severity of these symptoms varies widely between individuals, and most people recover fully within six months to one year.", "Guillain-Barre Syndrome is diagnosed based on a history of rapidly progressing weakness or tingling sensation that begins in the feet and/or legs, and then spreads upward to the arms and upper body. The diagnosis is made after excluding other possible causes of the symptoms, such as spinal cord injury, tumor or multiple sclerosis.", "Treatment for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome depends on the severity of the case. Milder cases can be treated at home with bed rest, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and supportive care. Medications such as immunoglobulins may also be used to treat milder cases. In more severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized. Treatments include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and high doses of corticosteroids.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a neurological disorder that causes nerve cells to malfunction and die. The body's immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. In some cases, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome may also affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary actions such as breathing and heart rate. Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome can occur at any age but is most commonly seen in adults aged 50 to 60. It is more likely to affect men than women and is more common in people of Asian, African, and Native American descent.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves in your body. It causes muscles to weaken and atrophy and can make you feel very fatigued. Although anyone can develop Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, certain groups are at higher risk than others. These include those over age 50, people with a family history of the condition, those with certain diseases, such as diabetes, cancer or lupus, and people who recently had a viral or bacterial infection, particularly influenza.", "In addition to taking medications prescribed by a physician, there are some things that individuals can do at home to help manage the symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. These include exercising regularly, eating healthy foods and getting plenty of sleep. Additionally, it's important to keep your doctor informed about any new or worsening symptoms.", "Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that occurs when the pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone. Growth hormone is made in the anterior pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. It is produced by cells called somatotrophs, and helps control many body functions including growth and development. In people with acromegaly, the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone and causes the liver and pancreas to make too much insulin. This excess growth hormone and insulin can cause the following symptoms: enlarged hands, feet and jaw; headache; vision problems; and diabetes.", "Acromegaly is a disorder characterized by excess growth hormone secretion that occurs in adults. It is caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland that produces too much growth hormone. This can result in symptoms like thickened lips, tongue or jaw; enlarged nose or ears; deepened voice; and large hands and feet. In addition, individuals with acromegaly may experience vision problems and headaches. Other symptoms of this condition include excess sweating and flushing, as well as joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.", "Acromegaly is diagnosed by measuring levels of growth hormone in the blood, as well as determining if growth hormone is being produced by the body. The diagnosis may be made using a blood sample or with imaging studies, such as a CT scan, MRI, or a bone scan. In some cases, a biopsy of the tumor is performed to confirm the diagnosis.", "The goal of treatment is to normalize hormone levels, and this is done through surgery to remove the tumor, medications or radiation therapy. If a tumor cannot be removed or destroyed, the doctor may prescribe medication to lower hormone levels. These medications are used to control growth of the tumor.", "Acromegaly can cause many complications, including hypertension, sleep apnea, and heart disease. It can also affect the teeth and jaw, causing changes to the mouth and face. In addition, people who have acromegaly are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.", "The prognosis for someone with acromegaly depends on several factors, including the amount of time it takes to diagnose and treat the condition. Generally, acromegaly is not fatal, but if not treated early enough, it can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes and heart disease. Treating acromegaly usually involves taking medication to lower the levels of growth hormone in the body. If this doesn't work, surgery may be necessary. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used.", "Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on a woman's medical history and symptoms, along with a physical examination. Women with symptoms such as vaginal discharge, vaginal odor and vaginal itching are at high risk for bacterial vaginosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed using a cotton swab test that detects an increase of certain bacteria in the vagina. In some cases, a sample of vaginal discharge may be collected to send to a lab for testing.", "Bacterial vaginosis is a very common vaginal infection. Its symptoms may include a strong fish-like odor, thin white or gray vaginal discharge and burning during urination. The symptoms may also be accompanied by irritation of the vagina and vulva (the outer lips of the vagina) and sometimes fever. If these symptoms persist, it is best to visit a health care provider.", "Bacterial vaginosis is a bacterial infection of the vagina, which is characterized by thin white discharge. In most cases, the infection clears up on its own without treatment. If treatment is necessary, antibiotics can be prescribed to help kill off the bacteria causing the infection. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions exactly for treatment, since some antibiotics can cause yeast infections or make your condition worse if not taken properly.", "Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina is thrown off, allowing harmful bacteria to grow and take over the area. There are many things that can cause this imbalance, including sexual intercourse with multiple partners, using an intrauterine device, douching, smoking and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, can lead to serious complications if it is not treated. If left untreated, BV can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. PID occurs when the infection moves up to a woman's reproductive organs, while infertility results from scarring of the fallopian tubes. In addition, untreated BV increases the risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women who have had BV once are at increased risk of having it again.", "Bacterial vaginosis can be prevented by practicing good hygiene habits such as washing the vagina and the surrounding skin with plain water every day and not douching. Women who are sexually active should always use condoms during intercourse to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, which can increase the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.", "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by seizures that cannot be attributed to another cause. Seizures may involve a change in behavior, consciousness, or movement, and are often accompanied by temporary changes in vision, hearing or smell. These episodes may last from a few seconds to several minutes. Some individuals experience only a single seizure during their lifetime, while others may experience hundreds.", "In most cases, epilepsy is diagnosed by a neurologist, who will take a detailed history and conduct a physical examination. He or she may also perform tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or computerized tomography (CT scan). An EEG records the electrical activity of the brain. The CT scan can show structural problems in the brain, such as tumors or malformations. If seizures are not controlled with anti-seizure medication, the doctor may recommend a procedure called vagus nerve stimulation. This involves implanting a pacemaker-like device under the skin of the chest, which sends electrical impulses to the brain via the vagus nerve.", "Treatment for epilepsy depends on the type of seizure and the severity of the condition. Medication is the main treatment for most forms of epilepsy. Anticonvulsant drugs help control seizures in most patients. Some drugs work better than others for specific types of seizures. If a person experiences side effects or the drug is not effective, the doctor may change the prescription or try another type of medicine. In some cases, surgery may be an option. If medications don't control the seizures, surgery may help remove the part of the brain causing the seizures.", "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that is characterized by recurring seizures. Seizures may occur at any time during a person's lifetime and can be triggered by many factors. These triggers can be categorized into three main categories: physical, emotional and environmental. Physical triggers include lack of sleep, fatigue, high fever, and intense exercise. Emotional triggers include stress, fear, grief and depression. Environmental triggers include bright lights, loud noises, flashing lights, alcohol and certain foods.", "Lifestyle changes can help manage epilepsy and make seizures less likely. These include avoiding stress, getting enough sleep and exercising regularly. Limiting alcohol intake and not smoking can also help.", "Epilepsy can have a wide range of effects on daily life, depending on the type and severity of seizures, the frequency of seizures and the effectiveness of the treatment. Some individuals with epilepsy may be able to live normal lives without any disruption to their daily activities. Other individuals may have frequent seizures that interfere with their ability to work and participate in daily activities.", "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up in the space between the lungs and chest wall, causing pressure on the lungs and difficulty breathing. It can occur on its own, or as a result of another disease. The most common cause is cancer. Other causes include autoimmune disorders, infections and trauma. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but it can involve draining the excess fluid, administering diuretics and/or treating the underlying disease.", "Pleural effusion is usually diagnosed using a chest x-ray. If there is fluid on the outside of the lungs, it will appear white on the x-ray. In some cases, a CT scan may be used to diagnose pleural effusion. A CT scan can help determine if there are any other problems in the chest besides the fluid buildup. Pleural effusion may be diagnosed during a routine physical examination. During this procedure, a doctor will tap on the chest and listen for abnormal sounds that indicate fluid buildup. If pleural effusion is suspected, a doctor may order a chest x-ray and a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.", "Pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid between the layers of the lining that surrounds the lungs (the pleura). Common symptoms include shortness of breath and a sharp chest pain that gets worse when lying down. Pleural effusion occurs more frequently in people with heart failure or lung cancer, and may also be seen in those with rheumatoid arthritis or cirrhosis of the liver.", "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up around the lungs. There are many reasons why this happens, but it usually occurs because the lung's membranes are irritated or inflamed. Some of the possible causes include: 1. Infections: Pneumonia, tuberculosis, influenza, and other infections can cause the pleura to swell and fill with fluid. 2. Lung cancer: Malignancies in the lung, such as non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, can cause pleural effusions. 3. Other cancers: Some cancers, such as breast cancer, can spread to the lungs and cause pleural effusions. 4. Pulmonary embolism: When a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the lungs, this can cause the pleura to fill with fluid. 5. Heart failure: If the heart cannot", "The first line of treatment for pleural effusion is to identify and treat the underlying cause. If this is not possible, then drainage of the pleural fluid may be necessary. The two main methods of draining pleural fluid are thoracentesis and pleurodesis. Thoracentesis is a procedure where the fluid is drained from the chest cavity using a needle inserted through the chest wall. Pleurodesis is a procedure where a chemical is used to adhere the lining of the lung to the inside of the chest wall. This prevents further accumulation of fluid in the space between the lung and the chest wall.", "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid accumulates between the membranes that line the chest cavity (pleura) and lungs. The fluid can cause chest pain, shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but can include medication, drainage of the fluid, and sometimes, surgery. Medications can help decrease the amount of fluid in the chest and decrease the pressure on the lungs, allowing them to work more effectively. If the cause of the pleural effusion cannot be controlled, draining the fluid through a needle can provide relief. In some cases, the excess fluid must be drained surgically, and this procedure is known as thoracentesis.", "The most common symptom of pancreatic cancer is abdominal pain, but there are many other possible signs and symptoms of this disease. These can include weight loss, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dark urine, light-colored stools, and diabetes.", "Pancreatic cancer is diagnosed by imaging tests like computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These tests can help identify any growths or masses in the pancreas, which could indicate cancer. Doctors will also look for signs of jaundice or elevated liver enzymes, as these are also indicators of pancreatic cancer. If the doctor suspects cancer, a biopsy will be performed. In some cases, biopsies can be done through a needle that's inserted into the pancreas during imaging tests. However, this method isn't always effective. Instead, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the tumor and determine if the cancer has spread.", "Pancreatic cancer is a very difficult disease to treat because the cancer cells are so resistant to standard therapies. Surgery is rarely used to treat this type of cancer, but it is possible to remove the tumor in some cases. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily increase survival, since most patients develop advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. In addition, chemotherapy and radiation are generally used as adjuvant therapies following surgery. These therapies are intended to eliminate any remaining cancer cells that might have been missed during the surgical procedure. The main goal of these therapies is to extend survival and improve quality of life.", "The pancreas is located behind the stomach and produces hormones that regulate blood sugar levels as well as enzymes that help the body break down food. It is made up of exocrine tissue, which produces enzymes to aid in digestion, and endocrine tissue, which produces hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer occurs when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, forming tumors that can spread to other parts of the body.", "Pancreatic cancer is more likely to develop in individuals with certain risk factors. These include age, family history and ethnicity, as well as obesity and smoking. Other risk factors for this type of cancer include having diabetes, exposure to chemicals at work, and having had gallstones.", "Pancreatic cancer is a difficult disease to detect early because there are few symptoms, and those that do exist are often mistaken for other conditions. While it is not possible to prevent pancreatic cancer, certain factors may increase your risk of developing the disease. These factors include smoking, obesity and high alcohol intake. People who smoke or drink heavily are at greater risk for developing pancreatic cancer than non-smokers or light drinkers.
