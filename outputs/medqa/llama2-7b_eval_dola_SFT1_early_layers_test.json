Blackheads are the result of a plugged pore that is filled with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. This plug can then be pushed to the surface of the skin and turn black when exposed to air. Whiteheads occur when the plug is trapped underneath the skin's surface. They are usually more painful than blackheads and may leave scars.\nAcne can also be categorized as either inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Inflammatory acne occurs when the hair follicle becomes infected by bacteria and results in swelling and redness. Non-inflammatory acne does not have any redness or swelling associated with it and is usually less severe than inflammatory acne.", "Several studies have found that eating a healthy, well-balanced diet can help reduce the frequency and severity of acne. Eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may also reduce inflammation in the body and improve overall skin health.

These complications are usually associated with high fevers, abdominal pain, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea.", "A person with dengue fever may be contagious for 3 to 5 days. After that, it's unlikely they will be able to spread the infection. However, if they have been sick for more than a week and have not recovered, it's possible that they could still be contagious.", "Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that causes hardening and tightening of the skin. This condition is also called systemic sclerosis, because it can affect other organs in the body, such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and intestines.\nThe most common symptom of scleroderma is tightening of the skin on the face, neck, chest, arms and legs. This can be accompanied by a red, scaly rash. Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, Raynaud's phenomenon (when blood vessels narrow and restrict blood flow), digestive problems and shortness of breath.", "Scleroderma is a chronic (long-term) connective tissue disorder that involves the skin, blood vessels and internal organs. It is characterized by excessive formation of collagen, which results in thickening of the skin, tightening of the skin and internal organs, and hardening of blood vessels. Scleroderma can be classified into two main types: limited and diffuse. The limited type affects only the skin and internal organs, while the diffuse form affects the entire body.\nDiagnosis is usually based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination and laboratory tests. There is no specific test for scleroderma. However, a variety of laboratory tests may be used to help make the diagnosis, including blood tests to look for inflammation or other signs of autoimmune disease, as well as imaging studies of the lungs and kidneys.", "Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissue of the body. This can lead to hardening and thickening of the skin, as well as problems with blood vessels, internal organs and other tissues. Treatment of scleroderma focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing complications.\nTreatment depends on the specific type of scleroderma, the severity of the condition and the patient's overall health. For people with localized scleroderma, treatment may include medications that reduce inflammation or suppress the immune system, as well as physical therapy to improve range of motion. People with systemic scleroderma may need to take immunosuppressant drugs to control their symptoms. In some cases, patients may require a kidney transplant if their kidneys have been damaged by the disease.", "Scleroderma is a chronic, systemic disease that can affect multiple organs. It causes thickening and hardening of the skin and connective tissue in the body, and can lead to complications such as lung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis), heart failure and kidney disease. Scleroderma can also cause Raynaud's phenomenon, which is characterized by spasms in the small arteries that supply blood to the fingers, toes and nose, causing them to turn white or blue in response to cold or stress.", "Scleroderma is a rare autoimmune disease in which the body produces excess collagen, leading to the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissue. The exact cause of this condition is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. Scleroderma affects women more often than men, and most people who develop the condition are between 30 and 50 years old. People who have a family history of this condition may be at a higher risk for developing it themselves, and those with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune diseases also have a higher risk.", "Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes hardening of the skin and connective tissues in the body. This can result in problems with the lungs, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.

The tumor can be either benign or malignant, but most are benign. This condition is also referred to as gigantism. It is caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors secrete excess amounts of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).\nHow is acromegaly diagnosed?\nAcromegaly is usually diagnosed by measuring IGF-1 levels and doing an MRI scan of the pituitary gland. If there is evidence of a pituitary tumor on the scan, a biopsy may be taken. A blood test called a GH Stimulation Test can be done to confirm the diagnosis.", "A person with acromegaly may experience enlargement of the hands, feet and face. This is caused by a thickening of the bones in the skull, face, hands and feet. The face may become more square-shaped.

However, they may be able to reduce or stop taking their medication if their tumor shrinks and hormone levels return to normal.", "Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed through a pelvic exam and a sample of the discharge from the vagina. The doctor will look for signs of infection, such as inflammation or redness, as well as smell the vaginal discharge to see if there is an odor. A swab of the vaginal discharge will also be taken for further testing. If a woman has symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, she should see her health care provider.", "Bacterial vaginosis is a condition that occurs when there is an imbalance between the good and bad bacteria in the vagina.
