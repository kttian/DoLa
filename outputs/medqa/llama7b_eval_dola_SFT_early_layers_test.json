Other risk factors include advanced maternal age, premature birth and exposure to environmental toxins.", "Social skills training is a common intervention used to help children with autism spectrum disorder improve their social interactions. This type of therapy focuses on teaching children how to interact appropriately with others, such as how to greet someone, make eye contact, ask questions and respond to questions. Children with autism spectrum disorder often have difficulty understanding nonverbal communication, so social skills training also teaches them how to read facial expressions and body language.", "Acne is caused by a combination of factors, including hormones, bacteria and oil production. Hormonal changes during puberty are the main cause of acne in teenagers. In adults, hormonal changes related to pregnancy, menstruation and birth control pills can also cause acne. Bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes live on the skin and contribute to acne. These bacteria feed on sebum, which is produced by the skin's oil glands. Sebum combines with dead skin cells to create a plug that blocks the opening of the hair follicle. This leads to inflammation and redness.", "Acne is a very common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It occurs when oil and dead skin cells clog pores, causing bacteria to grow inside the pore. This results in redness, swelling and pus-filled lesions. There are many different treatments available for acne, including topical creams, oral medications and laser therapy. Topical creams are the most commonly used treatment for acne, and these come in many forms, such as lotions, gels, foams and cleansers. Oral medications are also effective at treating acne, and these include antibiotics, hormonal agents and retinoids. Laser therapy is another option for treating acne, and this involves using light energy to destroy the bacteria that cause acne.", "Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It occurs when oil and dead skin cells clog pores, causing bacteria to grow inside the pore. This results in redness, swelling, pus and sometimes scarring. There are many different types of acne, including blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules and cysts. Blackheads are closed comedones that appear as dark spots on the skin. Whiteheads are closed comedones that do not have any visible opening at the surface of the skin. Papules are raised lesions that are red or pink in color. Pustules are similar to papules, but contain pus. Nodules are large, solid lumps under the skin that are painful. Cysts are sacs filled with pus that are painful and can cause scarring.", "Acne is a skin condition that occurs when oil and dead skin cells clog pores. It is most common among teenagers, but can affect adults as well. Diet plays a role in acne because certain foods can increase the amount of oil produced by the body. Foods that are high in fat and cholesterol can contribute to acne, as can dairy products, sugar and processed foods. In addition, some studies have shown that eating too much protein can also contribute to acne.", "Hygiene plays a large role in acne because it helps control oil production and prevents the buildup of bacteria on the skin. Acne occurs when pores become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, which allows bacteria to grow. This can lead to inflammation and redness, which is why proper hygiene is so important. Washing the face twice daily with a gentle cleanser and using a noncomedogenic moisturizer can help keep pores clear and reduce the risk of breakouts.", "Acne is a very common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide.

These tests may include a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).", "Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. It is characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which results in the formation of crescent-shaped red blood cells. These cells tend to stick together and block blood flow, causing painful episodes known as crises. Treatment for sickle cell disease depends on the severity of the disease and the age of the patient. Children with sickle cell disease are typically treated with hydroxyurea, which helps reduce the number of crises. Adults with sickle cell disease are typically treated with transfusions of normal red blood cells.", "Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. It causes the body to produce abnormal red blood cells that are shaped like crescent moons. These cells are stiff and sticky, which makes them prone to blocking blood flow. This can lead to painful episodes known as crises, which can last anywhere from hours to days. Other symptoms of sickle cell disease include fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the hands and feet, frequent infections and jaundice.", "Sickle cell disease is inherited, meaning it is passed down from parents to children. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that makes hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. People who inherit two copies of the mutated gene develop sickle cell disease. Those who inherit only one copy of the mutated gene are carriers of the disease and do not have sickle cell disease themselves, but they can pass the mutated gene onto their children.", "Sickle cell disease is a chronic condition that affects red blood cells. It is characterized by episodes of pain, fatigue and anemia. There is no cure for sickle cell disease, but there are many treatments available to help manage the symptoms.

Hormone therapy is also sometimes used to slow the growth of the cancer.", "Ovarian cancer is a disease in which cells in the ovary grow out of control. It is the fifth most common cancer among women and the eighth leading cause of cancer death among women. Ovarian cancer can affect the entire body, but it is most commonly found in the pelvis and abdomen. Common symptoms include bloating, pelvic pain, difficulty eating, fatigue and nausea.", "Risk factors for ovarian cancer include age, family history, obesity, infertility, hormone replacement therapy and smoking. Women who are 50 years old or older are at higher risk for developing ovarian cancer, and women who have a family history of ovarian cancer are also at increased risk. Obesity, infertility and hormone replacement therapy are all associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Smoking is not directly linked to ovarian cancer, but it increases the risk of many other cancers, including breast, lung, colon and pancreatic cancer.", "Unfortunately, there are no known preventative measures for ovarian cancer. However, women who are at high risk for developing ovarian cancer may benefit from screening tests such as transvaginal ultrasound and CA125 blood test.

In addition, the virus can be spread by sharing eating utensils, drinking glasses or other objects that have been contaminated with saliva.", "Influenza is typically treated with antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). These drugs work best when started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Antiviral medications can reduce the duration of the illness by about one day. Other treatments include rest, fluids and fever reducers. If the person is very sick, hospitalization may be necessary.", "There are two types of influenza vaccines available: inactivated and live attenuated. Inactivated vaccines contain killed viruses and are given as shots. Live attenuated vaccines are given as nasal sprays. Both types of vaccines protect against three strains of influenza.", "Influenza is a respiratory illness that can be very serious, especially in certain populations.
