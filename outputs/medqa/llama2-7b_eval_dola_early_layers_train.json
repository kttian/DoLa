vessel carrying oxygen to the brain is blocked or ruptures, causing the death of the cells in that part of the brain. Common symptoms include sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side; sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes; sudden dizziness, loss of balance, or difficulty walking; and sudden, severe headache with no known cause.", "Stroke symptoms may appear suddenly or gradually over time. In either case, the person should seek medical help immediately. If the symptoms last longer than 24 hours, the person should still see a physician. Diagnosis of a stroke starts with a physical examination and a detailed history of the patient's symptoms. A doctor may order blood tests and a computerized tomography scan, or CT, of the head to confirm a diagnosis.", "The primary goal of treatment is to limit damage to the brain, and to minimize disability and improve quality of life. The specific treatments used will depend on the type of stroke and its severity. In some cases, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, the goal of treatment may be to stop or slow down the effects of the stroke, or to reverse the damage that has already occurred. This may involve the use of drugs such as aspirin, heparin, or thrombolytics, as well as surgery or other procedures.", "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and the leading cause of disability. There are many risk factors for stroke, including high blood pressure, smoking, being overweight, having a family history of stroke, and having certain diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. Risk factors can also include having had a previous stroke, having atrial fibrillation or heart attack, and using illegal drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamines. Other risk factors include being female and being older than 65 years of age.", "An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel carrying oxygen to the brain becomes blocked. A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing blood to leak out into the surrounding tissues. Both strokes can result in damage to the brain, and can cause loss of function. The main difference is that an ischemic stroke can cause damage to the brain because it's not receiving enough blood flow. In a hemorrhagic stroke, damage is caused when too much blood enters the brain.", "Reducing your risk of suffering a stroke is important, because strokes are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 15 million people die each year from strokes, accounting for about 28% of all deaths globally. Stroke occurs when a blood vessel carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain either becomes blocked or bursts. If the blockage lasts longer than five minutes, it can cause brain damage. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes and being overweight. It's also important to control stress, get plenty of sleep and exercise regularly.", "Insomnia is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep. Symptoms of insomnia include difficulty falling asleep, waking up too early in the morning, difficulty staying awake during the daytime hours and frequent nighttime awakenings. Insomnia may be caused by stress, depression or anxiety. Other factors that can cause insomnia include chronic pain, jet lag, changes in work schedules, menopause, and sleep apnea.", "There is no single test used to diagnose insomnia, and the diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms and history of sleep disturbances. Your doctor will ask questions about your sleep habits and try to identify possible causes of insomnia. In some cases, a sleep study is required. If insomnia is chronic and doesn't improve with self-care strategies, you should see a doctor.", "Insomnia is a sleep disorder that affects about 10% of the general population. Insomnia can be classified as either transient (lasting for less than a month) or chronic (lasting longer than a month). The most common treatment for insomnia is behavioral therapy, which helps people to identify and change negative behaviors that interfere with sleep. In some cases, medications may also be used to treat insomnia, but these are generally only prescribed when behavioral therapy fails.", "Insomnia is not just sleepless nights; it is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or both, for at least three months. Insomnia is one of the most common sleep complaints in the United States and can occur at any age. It is estimated that up to 30 percent of adults experience insomnia each year, and about 10 percent of adults have long-term insomnia. Insomnia can cause daytime tiredness, irritability, depression, and problems concentrating and performing tasks. It also increases the risk of accidents at home and work.", "Some risk factors for developing insomnia include depression and anxiety disorders. Other risk factors include poor sleep habits, shift work and excessive alcohol consumption. Age may also play a role in developing insomnia. Older adults tend to experience more frequent and longer lasting sleep disruptions due to normal changes in the body's ability to regulate temperature, hormone levels and sleep cycles.", "In general, there are several lifestyle changes that may help alleviate insomnia symptoms. Some people find that a consistent sleep schedule helps, so going to bed and waking up at the same time each day is important. Maintaining a regular exercise routine and eating well can also help improve sleep. Cutting down on caffeine, alcohol, nicotine and large meals in the evening may also be beneficial. Other tips to improve sleep quality include reducing light exposure in the bedroom and using relaxation techniques before bedtime.", "Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among women, so it is important to recognize any unusual changes to your breasts. While breast cancer can occur at any age, women should begin performing monthly self-breast exams starting in their 20s. If a woman notices any of the following changes to her breasts, she should consult with a physician immediately: new lumps or thickening of the breast or underarm area; dimpling or puckering of the skin; discharge from the nipples; changes in the size or shape of the breast; redness or scaliness of the nipple or breast skin.", "Breast cancer is usually diagnosed based on a woman's history of symptoms, physical examination findings and results from a mammogram. A biopsy is usually done to confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer, and determine if it is invasive cancer. Once breast cancer has been diagnosed, additional tests are done to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer, and whether it has spread beyond the breast.", "Breast cancer is treated based on the location and stage of the tumor. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. In some cases, hormone therapy may be used to reduce the risk of recurrence.", "Women who have a family history of breast cancer have an increased risk of developing breast cancer themselves. Other factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer include obesity, early menstruation, late menopause, having children later in life, not having children, using hormone replacement therapy and smoking.", "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, and its prevalence increases as women age. Women are at risk of developing breast cancer if they have a family history of the disease or if they have certain genetic mutations, such as those associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, lifestyle choices are also important factors in the development of breast cancer. Some research indicates that having a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for breast cancer. Women who are overweight or obese may be at increased risk of developing breast cancer because excess fat cells make estrogen, which may promote the growth of cancer cells. Other risk factors for breast cancer include smoking, not being physically active, drinking alcohol, and consuming a high-fat diet.", "Breast cancer can have a huge impact on the quality of life for those affected by it. It may interfere with activities such as work or school and may make it difficult to carry out normal daily tasks. In some cases, breast cancer may lead to disfigurement, as it may change the way a woman looks. It may also cause financial difficulties if treatment is not covered by insurance.", "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin build up in the body. It is characterized by agitation, hallucinations, high blood pressure and a fast heart rate. It can also cause diarrhea, fever, sweating and muscle spasms. If not treated quickly, serotonin syndrome can be fatal.", "Serotonin syndrome is diagnosed based on a combination of signs and symptoms that are suggestive of the disorder, along with a thorough medical history and physical examination. Serotonin syndrome occurs when high levels of serotonin accumulate in the body, which may happen when certain medications or drugs interact with other substances that increase serotonin levels. Symptoms include sweating, fever, muscle rigidity, tremors, nausea and vomiting. If a person is showing any signs of serotonin syndrome, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.", "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially serious medical condition that occurs when a person takes too much serotonergic drugs. These medications work by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the body. Examples include certain antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, as well as some antianxiety and antipsychotic medications. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include fever, sweating, muscle twitches or spasms, diarrhea, vomiting and changes in behavior, such as agitation and confusion. In more severe cases, seizures or coma can occur. The treatment of serotonin syndrome is based on the underlying cause, as well as the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases of serotonin syndrome can be managed by stopping the offending drug and treating the symptoms.", "Serotonin syndrome occurs when the body produces too much serotonin, a chemical that helps regulate mood, sleep and behavior. It is usually caused by the use of certain drugs that increase serotonin levels in the body, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). The symptoms of serotonin syndrome can range from mild to severe, but generally include changes in mental state (such as confusion or hallucinations), agitation, muscle spasms, tremors, fever, sweating and diarrhea.", "Serotonin syndrome is usually treated with medication and supportive care. In some cases, medication is adjusted or discontinued. Supportive care includes hydrating the patient and providing assistance with breathing and circulation. If necessary, intravenous fluids and medications to control blood pressure and heart rate are administered.", "Serotonin syndrome occurs when high levels of serotonin are released into the central nervous system, resulting in symptoms such as confusion, muscle rigidity, rapid heart rate and changes in mental status. Although most cases of serotonin syndrome are not life-threatening, they can be very serious and require immediate medical attention. Complications that may arise from serotonin syndrome include seizures, coma, delirium tremens, hyperpyrexia and even death.", "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder that involves the immune system attacking the lining of the digestive tract, resulting in inflammation and ulcers. IBD has two primary forms, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. Ulcerative colitis is limited to the large intestine (colon and rectum). Symptoms of both conditions may include abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea, constipation and weight loss.", "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term used to describe diseases that involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. There are two main types of IBD: ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Ulcerative colitis affects only the colon (large intestine), while Crohn\u2019s disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus.", "Inflammatory bowel disease is diagnosed using a combination of methods. First, your doctor will perform a physical exam to check for signs of IBD. Next, a stool sample may be taken to check for the presence of blood or mucus. Your doctor may also ask you to undergo a colonoscopy. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is inserted into your rectum and used to look inside your colon and rectum to see if any ulcers, sores or polyps are present. Finally, your doctor may order imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.", "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term used to describe two chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestines. Ulcerative colitis is the most common type of IBD, affecting about 20 percent of all those diagnosed with IBD. It occurs when the colon and rectum are inflamed. Crohn\u2019s disease, which occurs in about 80 percent of all IBD patients, affects any part of the GI tract, but most commonly involves the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. The main difference between ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease is that ulcerative colitis only involves the inner lining of the colon while Crohn\u2019s disease involves the deeper layers of the colon.", "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic conditions that cause inflammation of the intestinal tract. These include Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD is usually treated with medications such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and anti-inflammatory agents. Some people with Crohn\u2019s disease also need surgery.", "Lifestyle changes can help manage inflammatory bowel disease in several ways. By maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active, individuals with inflammatory bowel disease can reduce stress, which can be a trigger for flare-ups. In addition, eating a well-balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean protein, and limiting red meat and saturated fats can help control inflammatory bowel disease. Also, getting enough rest, drinking plenty of fluids and managing stress levels can help improve quality of life.", "Symptoms of cirrhosis vary depending on the stage of the disease, but commonly include fatigue, weight loss, nausea, vomiting and jaundice. Some patients may also experience loss of appetite, weakness, muscle spasms, swelling in the legs and feet, and confusion and disorientation. If you experience any of these symptoms, see your physician right away.", "Diagnosis of cirrhosis involves a thorough physical examination, which includes checking the lymph nodes and liver for swelling, checking the spleen and liver for tenderness and listening for any unusual sounds in the liver. Your physician may also conduct lab tests, including blood tests to check liver enzyme levels. Other diagnostic procedures include ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the liver. If your doctor suspects that cirrhosis has developed into liver cancer, a biopsy may be performed.", "Treatments for cirrhosis depend on the severity of the disease and whether it is causing symptoms. Some individuals will not need any treatment, while others may require medication to control the symptoms. Liver transplant is the only known cure for cirrhosis, but is only an option for people whose livers have failed and are no longer working properly. Liver transplant is not available for everyone with cirrhosis, however, so other treatments may be necessary. Medications, including those to treat symptoms like ascites and varices, may be prescribed. Lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight and limiting alcohol intake, can help slow the progression of the disease.", "Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver becomes scarred, damaged and eventually stops working properly. When cirrhosis develops, the liver cannot remove toxins and nutrients from the body effectively. As a result, the body accumulates these substances, causing symptoms like nausea, fatigue, weight loss and jaundice. Cirrhosis can be caused by a number of factors including excessive alcohol consumption and chronic viral hepatitis. Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the liver damage, and may involve lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, a liver transplant.", "Several factors can increase a person's risk of developing cirrhosis, including: Age - Cirrhosis most commonly occurs in people ages 40 to 60, but it can occur at any age. Family history - If your parents or siblings have liver disease, you may be at increased risk of developing cirrhosis. Gender - Men are more likely than women to develop cirrhosis. Alcohol use - Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver damage and cirrhosis. Obesity - Carrying extra weight increases pressure on the liver. Diabetes - People with diabetes are more likely to develop liver disease and cirrhosis. Other causes - Certain diseases such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C increase the risk of cirrhosis. Autoimmune disorders such as primary sclerosing cholangitis can cause cirrhos", "Making certain lifestyle changes is important for managing cirrhosis. It is important to limit alcohol consumption, eat a healthy diet, get enough rest, exercise regularly, quit smoking, and reduce stress. Limiting alcohol consumption is especially important for individuals who have cirrhosis, because alcohol consumption can increase pressure on the liver. Additionally, cirrhosis can be worsened by excessive salt intake, so it is important to limit salt intake. It is also important to maintain a healthy weight, as obesity can put additional strain on the liver.", "The symptoms of kidney cancer can vary, and include blood in the urine, pain in the side or back, fever, fatigue, weight loss and swelling of the feet. However, these symptoms are not specific to kidney cancer, so they are often not related to the disease. Most people with kidney cancer do not experience any symptoms at all until the disease has progressed to a late stage. In many cases, the first sign of the disease is an abnormality on imaging studies such as a CT scan or ultrasound.", "Diagnosis of kidney cancer begins with a physical examination, during which a medical professional will listen to your chest and feel your abdomen to check for any signs of enlargement or lumps. After the physical exam, a health care provider will likely order tests to determine whether the enlargement is due to kidney cancer, and to find out if cancer has spread. These tests may include CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, PET scan or biopsy.", "There are many treatment options for kidney cancer, and the appropriate course of treatment will depend on the stage and location of the tumor, as well as the age and overall health of the patient. Treatments include surgery to remove the cancerous kidney, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Some people may need a combination of treatments. In some cases, a biopsy is necessary to determine the type of kidney cancer and whether it has spread.", "There are four stages of kidney cancer, each representing the degree of progression. Stage 1 involves the presence of a solitary tumor that is smaller than 7 cm (about 3 inches) across. Stage 2 indicates the tumor is larger than 7 cm, but not larger than 10 cm. Stage 3 indicates the tumor is larger than 10 cm, and stage 4 means the tumor is larger than 10 cm and has spread to other parts of the body.", "The exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown. However, some risk factors are known. These include smoking, obesity, high blood pressure and a family history of the disease. Other possible risk factors are exposure to certain chemicals and radiation.", "It is difficult to reduce the risk of developing kidney cancer because it is not clear what causes this type of cancer. Some studies suggest that obesity may increase the risk of developing kidney cancer, so maintaining a healthy weight may help. Other factors that may increase risk include high blood pressure, smoking, and having certain inherited conditions such as polycystic kidney disease. People who have a family history of kidney cancer, particularly first-degree relatives like parents, siblings or children, should discuss this risk with their physician.", "Yellow fever is a viral infection transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache and muscle aches, followed by nausea, vomiting and jaundice.

Because of its high risk for complications, heat stroke must be treated immediately by emergency personnel. Treatment will depend on the severity of the patient's condition, but may include IV fluids and cooling measures such as ice packs or sponging the patient with cool water. In addition, medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen can be used to lower a patient's fever.", "Heat stroke is a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body cannot control its temperature. Heat exhaustion, on the other hand, is a less serious condition that occurs when the body loses too much fluid and salt. Heat exhaustion is typically caused by being exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time. Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and headache.", "Heat stroke occurs when a person's body cannot regulate its internal temperature, causing the body temperature to rise rapidly. To prevent heat stroke, individuals should wear loose fitting, light colored clothing made of natural fibers. They should drink plenty of fluids, preferably water. It's also important to find a cool, shady place to rest in during hot weather. When at work or school, employers and educators should make sure to offer adequate cooling stations.", "Heat stroke occurs when a person becomes so overheated that the body is unable to regulate its temperature, causing damage to the body's organs and systems. When this happens, the body loses its ability to sweat. As a result, the body is unable to cool itself down. The brain becomes overloaded by the excessive heat and the person collapses and may become unconscious. In extreme cases, death may result. Heat stroke is the most severe form of heat illness, but the lesser forms of heat illness - heat cramps and heat exhaustion - may occur first.", "The symptoms of anxiety disorders can vary depending on the specific type of disorder. Some common symptoms of anxiety include excessive worrying or fear, feeling easily fatigued, difficulty sleeping, irritability and restlessness, muscle tension and feelings of being on edge. Anxiety disorders can be treated with a combination of therapy, medication and lifestyle changes.", "Anxiety disorders are diagnosed by a mental health professional based on a psychiatric evaluation that includes a review of the person's medical history, physical examination, and interview. In addition to asking about symptoms, the mental health professional will want to know how long the anxiety has been going on and if there is any history of trauma, substance abuse, or depression. If necessary, the mental health professional may also order tests to rule out other causes of the anxiety, such as hyperthyroidism, heart disease, or anemia.", "Anxiety disorders are usually treated with therapy or medications. In addition to talk therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may help reduce anxiety symptoms. Medication may be used alone or in combination with therapy to treat anxiety. Common medications prescribed for anxiety disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines.", "Anxiety disorders can vary widely in severity and symptoms, with some people experiencing only mild anxiety while others experience extreme panic attacks or even phobias. Anxiety disorders are grouped into five main categories, based on their symptoms. These are generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by chronic, excessive worry and fear about everyday situations. Panic disorder involves recurrent sudden feelings of intense terror, or a sense of impending doom. Social anxiety disorder involves persistent fears of being judged or criticized by others in social situations.

Inherited genetic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also increase the risk of developing melanoma.", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is characterized by dry eyes and mouth. Other symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may include dry skin, vaginal dryness, joint pain, muscle weakness and fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, dry nose and throat, and a sensation of burning or grittiness in the eyes.", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms and physical examination findings. In addition, lab tests, such as the Schirmer tear test and blood tests, can help confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of the salivary glands can be helpful, but is not required to make a diagnosis.", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the glands that produce saliva and tears. The most common treatment for Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is the use of artificial tears to lubricate the eyes. Dry mouth can be treated with various types of oral rinses or prescription medications.", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is a disorder characterized by dry mouth and dry eyes, as well as chronic fatigue, joint pain, and muscle aches. This condition occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells. As a result, the glands that produce saliva and tears become inflamed. In addition, the glands that produce sweat are affected, causing excessive sweating in some individuals. This leads to an increased risk of developing certain infections and diseases.", "Complications associated with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may include dry eye and mouth, fatigue, depression and anxiety, joint and muscle pain, and Raynaud's phenomenon (a condition that causes blood vessels to narrow, restricting blood flow). Some women with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome experience vaginal dryness, making intercourse painful and difficult. Other complications include kidney problems, lungs problems, gastrointestinal issues and anemia.", "Lifestyle changes can be helpful for managing Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, especially if the patient's symptoms are severe. Exercise and physical activity can be beneficial in improving joint flexibility, increasing energy levels and reducing muscle aches and fatigue. Regular sleep is important for individuals who suffer from Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Patients may want to consider using a humidifier at night to increase moisture in the air and decrease dryness in the throat and nose.", "Athlete's foot is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the foot, especially between the toes. Common symptoms of athlete's foot include itching, burning, peeling and redness. In some cases, blisters may appear. This condition can be passed from person to person, so those who suffer from it should take steps to avoid spreading it to others, such as wearing shoes and socks in public places and using shower shoes when walking in locker rooms or public pools.", "Athlete's foot can be treated by using an anti-fungal cream, spray or lotion. Over-the-counter products that contain clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole or miconazole are effective at treating athlete's foot. These products can be applied directly to the affected areas or washed into the footwear to kill fungus in shoes. If these products don't work, your physician may prescribe stronger antifungal medications that you take by mouth or apply topically.", "Athlete's foot is caused by fungus that thrives in warm, moist environments. So, individuals should keep their feet dry and change socks and shoes frequently. They should also wear shoes made of breathable material like cotton or canvas, and make sure to dry their feet thoroughly after bathing. When using public showers or locker rooms, individuals should wear clean socks and flip-flops, and avoid walking barefoot. Finally, they should always use separate shoes at the gym and at the beach, as these places tend to harbor fungi.", "Athlete's foot, or tinea pedis, can spread to other parts of the body, particularly if the person has other fungal infections or a weakened immune system. If an athlete's foot infection is left untreated, the fungus can spread to the hands and feet, nails, scalp, and even the groin area. To prevent the spread of athlete's foot to other parts of the body, people should clean their feet daily using soap and water. They should also wear clean socks, change shoes regularly, and dry their feet thoroughly, especially between the toes.", "Athlete's foot is caused by fungi that thrive in moist environments. These fungi live in warm, damp areas like locker rooms and shower stalls, so they are easily spread from person to person. The fungi can be passed along through direct contact with someone who has it, or by walking barefoot on a surface that has been infected with the fungus.", "Athlete's foot, which is caused by fungus, can lead to many complications, such as painful blisters, itching, and cracking and peeling of the skin. In addition, the fungus can spread to other parts of the body and cause skin infections. Untreated athlete's foot can lead to serious problems, including nail damage and even hair loss.", "Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), occurs when the body cannot adjust to the lower oxygen levels at higher elevations. The most common symptom is headache, but others may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and fatigue. Some people also experience shortness of breath. Symptoms tend to improve within 24 hours as the body adjusts to the change in elevation. If symptoms persist or worsen, individuals should descend to a lower altitude.", "Preventing altitude sickness begins with being prepared. It is important to drink plenty of fluids, eat light meals, avoid alcohol, and rest at high elevations before traveling to higher altitudes. If you start experiencing symptoms of altitude sickness, try to descend to lower altitudes, and seek medical attention immediately if your symptoms become worse.", "Altitude sickness, or acute mountain sickness, is usually treated with rest, oxygen, acetazolamide, or a combination of all of these. Acetazolamide is a drug that helps speed up the rate at which your body gets used to high altitudes. It is often prescribed when traveling to higher elevations, although it should not be taken without medical advice. Rest, oxygen and acetazolamide are also used to treat altitude sickness.", "Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness, occurs when the body cannot adjust to lower amounts of oxygen at high altitudes. As altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, and less oxygen is available in each breath. When people reach a certain elevation, their bodies produce substances to help with this decrease in oxygen levels. If a person ascends too rapidly, his or her body may not have time to adjust to the change in oxygen levels, and altitude sickness can result.", "Yes. In rare cases, altitude sickness can progress to a serious or life-threatening condition. This is known as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), both of which can occur at elevations greater than 2,500 meters above sea level. HACE can occur within 48 hours of arriving at a high altitude and is marked by confusion and delirium. It is more likely to occur in those with chronic lung disease and/or heart problems. HAPE occurs when fluid collects in the lungs and can cause respiratory distress and shortness of breath. HAPE occurs within 24 to 36 hours of arrival at a high altitude.", "The symptoms of altitude sickness can appear anywhere from 24 hours to 2 days after ascending to high altitudes. Symptoms of altitude sickness include headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, and swollen hands and feet. These symptoms can vary in intensity, and some people may only experience mild symptoms while others may develop more severe symptoms. If you develop any of these symptoms, you should descend to lower altitudes as soon as possible.", "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes hair loss on the head, face and other parts of the body. It is thought that this condition is caused by an abnormal immune response, which attacks the hair follicles and prevents them from producing hair. Although alopecia areata can affect anyone at any age, it most commonly occurs in children, teens and young adults. It is estimated that between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent of the U.S. population suffers from this condition. The good news is that the vast majority of people with this condition will experience hair regrowth within a year.", "The common symptom of Alopecia areata is sudden hair loss in patches. In many cases, hair grows back within six months. But sometimes, it doesn't, and the hair may never grow back. Other symptoms include burning or tingling sensations in the scalp, as well as a rash. If a person experiences these symptoms, it is important to see a dermatologist, as the doctor can determine what the best course of treatment is.", "Alopecia areata is diagnosed by a medical professional using a visual examination. The hair loss will be visible and the diagnosis will be obvious. Sometimes, a biopsy of the bald patch will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.", "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss. While there is no known cure, there are several treatment options available. One option is steroid cream. Another is immunosuppressants. These are medications that work by suppressing the body\u2019s immune system. Finally, biologic therapy is an option. This is a new treatment option that uses drugs made from living organisms to help fight disease.", "Anyone can develop alopecia areata, but certain factors put people at a higher risk than others. These include: age - alopecia areata occurs most frequently between ages 15 and 30, although it can occur at any age; family history - if someone else in your family has alopecia areata, you are more likely to develop it; stress - stressful events such as divorce, childbirth or death of a loved one may trigger alopecia areata; race - African Americans are at greater risk for alopecia areata; autoimmune diseases - alopecia areata may be associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus, thyroid disease or vitiligo.", "There is no known cure for alopecia areata, so treatment is focused on alleviating symptoms and managing the condition. Some strategies for managing the condition include steroid injections and immunosuppressant drugs. Topical treatments such as minoxidil may also help to stimulate hair growth. In severe cases of alopecia areata, a hair transplant may be recommended.", "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive loss of kidney function that is not reversible. It occurs slowly over time, so individuals may not experience any symptoms for years. As the kidneys continue to lose function, they are no longer able to filter waste products from the blood, causing waste products to build up in the bloodstream. These waste products can affect many organs in the body and may result in swollen feet or ankles, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and confusion.", "Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease begins with a simple blood test that checks for the presence of creatinine, which is a waste product filtered out by the kidneys. In addition, a blood test to check for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be used to assess kidney function. Other tests may include a urinalysis, imaging tests such as ultrasounds or X-rays, and a kidney biopsy.", "Chronic kidney disease is usually treated by slowing its progression. There are many medications and treatments available for chronic kidney disease that help control symptoms, slow down the progression of the disease, and even reverse some of the damage caused by kidney disease. These include blood pressure medications, medications to decrease swelling, medications to lower phosphorous levels, vitamin D supplements, medications to improve red blood cell production, and dialysis. In advanced cases, a person may need a kidney transplant.", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when a person's kidneys lose the ability to filter waste products from the blood. CKD can be caused by many things, including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking and heredity. Other factors that increase the risk of developing CKD include age, gender and race. African Americans are more likely than white people to develop CKD. Hispanic Americans are more likely to have CKD than non-Hispanic whites. Men are more likely to have CKD than women. People with diabetes are more likely to have CKD than those without diabetes.", "There are five stages of chronic kidney disease. Stage 1 means that you have normal kidney function. In stage 2, your glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is between 90 and 89 mL/min/1.73m2. Stage 3 is classified as mild chronic kidney disease, as your GFR is between 60 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2. In stage 4, your GFR is between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2 and your kidneys are no longer working properly. Stage 5 is classified as severe chronic kidney disease, as your GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2.", "Chronic kidney disease is progressive, meaning it gets worse over time. There are many things that people can do to help slow its progression. These include maintaining a healthy weight, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, managing your blood pressure, and monitoring your blood sugar level. It's also important to follow the advice of your doctor regarding lifestyle changes and medications.", "The symptoms of Pellagra include: Skin lesions, especially on the palms and soles. Itching. Swelling and redness of the mouth. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Depression. Fatigue. Loss of appetite. Difficulty sleeping. Muscle weakness. Irritability. Mental problems such as delusions and hallucinations.", "Pellagra is a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin B3, or niacin, which is found in meat and other animal products. It is most commonly seen in malnourished populations, such as those living in poverty in underdeveloped countries. In these regions, diets tend to consist of corn and rice, which are not good sources of vitamin B3. As a result, many people in these communities develop pellagra.", "The primary treatment for pellagra is to increase vitamin B3 (niacin) intake. This can be done by increasing consumption of foods rich in niacin or taking a niacin supplement. Niacin deficiency is extremely rare in developed nations due to fortification of many staple foods.", "Pellagra is caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3) in the diet. It was once a common problem in the U.S., especially among poor populations, but it is now rare because of fortified grains, flours and cornmeal. To avoid developing this disease, individuals should make sure to eat plenty of foods high in niacin, such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs, legumes and whole grains. They should also try to limit the consumption of alcohol, as this can lead to a niacin deficiency.", "Niacin deficiency, also known as Pellagra, is a condition that results from a lack of niacin, also called vitamin B3. It was first described in 1905, in Argentina, where it was found that poorly fed people suffered from skin disorders, diarrhea and mental problems. In 1937, the American Journal of Dermatology reported the case of a woman who developed all of these symptoms due to her dietary intake of cornmeal, which contains no niacin. Niacin is found in meats, fish, eggs and whole grains, so those who eat a balanced diet rarely develop Pellagra.", "If Pellagra is left untreated, it can result in a wide variety of health problems. These include mental confusion, depression, dermatitis, diarrhea and anemia. Additionally, individuals suffering from Pellagra are at risk of developing heart disease. In some cases, death can result if the condition is not treated.", "Varicose veins are enlarged and dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin. They are often raised above the surface of the skin and appear blue or dark purple in color. These veins are commonly found on the legs and feet. They may be painful, itchy and sometimes cause swelling.", "Varicose veins can be diagnosed with a physical examination of the legs and feet, along with an evaluation of the medical history. An ultrasound test, called a Doppler test, can also help determine the location and extent of the problem. If varicose veins are causing discomfort or other problems, the doctor may recommend additional tests, such as an x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a venous duplex ultrasound. These tests can provide images of the veins in the legs and show if any blood clots are present.", "Varicose veins are enlarged and dilated blood vessels that are usually blue, purple or dark reddish-brown in color. These veins can appear anywhere on the body, but are most commonly seen on the legs. Varicose veins can be caused by weakened valves in the veins, or by obstructions to the flow of blood in the vein. Symptoms of varicose veins include swelling, heaviness and achiness in the legs, skin discoloration and itching, and sometimes ulcers or sores on the legs. If left untreated, varicose veins can lead to leg cramps, leg ulcers and venous insufficiency, which occurs when the veins cannot return blood to the heart.", "Treatment for varicose veins depends on the severity of the problem. In cases where the veins are not causing any problems, treatment is not necessary. However, if the veins are causing discomfort or pain, a medical professional can provide a number of different treatments. These include sclerotherapy, laser therapy and endovenous thermal ablation. In cases where the veins are very large, the medical professional may recommend a procedure called stripping and ligation. This procedure involves cutting out and tying off the vein so that it cannot return blood to the heart.", "Varicose veins occur when the valves inside the veins no longer work properly. When this happens, the vein cannot return blood back to the heart, so the blood pools in the veins and causes them to swell. There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing varicose veins. These include obesity, pregnancy, family history of varicose veins, smoking, age and occupations that require prolonged standing or sitting.", "Varicose veins can be prevented with lifestyle changes that promote circulation in the legs. These include walking regularly, wearing comfortable shoes and not sitting or standing in the same position for long periods of time. It is also important to lose weight if you are overweight. If these lifestyle changes do not help, your doctor may recommend compression stockings, which provide support to the leg veins, and elevating your feet while resting.", "The symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) vary from person to person and can include breast tenderness, irritability, bloating, headaches, cramps, fatigue, depression, trouble sleeping, acne and increased sensitivity to cold. Some women experience no symptoms at all. It is estimated that between 50 percent and 80 percent of menstruating women experience PMS to some degree. The exact cause of PMS is not known, but it is believed to be due to fluctuations in hormone levels. PMS is thought to be related to changes in estrogen, progesterone and serotonin levels during the second half of the menstrual cycle.", "Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a complex group of physical and emotional symptoms that occurs in some women during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle (the period of time between ovulation and the start of the next menstrual period). These symptoms may include breast tenderness, bloating, cramps, irritability, depression, headaches and fatigue. PMS is diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms, which must occur at least once per month, and last for at least a few days. The symptoms must also not be due to another medical condition.", "There are many treatment options available for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), including lifestyle changes, medications, and alternative therapies. Lifestyle changes that may help include exercising regularly, reducing stress, eating healthy and getting plenty of rest. Some medications used to treat PMS include anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and antidepressants. Alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and yoga may also help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with PMS.", "Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, affects up to 75% of women at some point in their lives. Although the exact cause of PMS is not known, hormonal changes in the body during menstruation appear to be responsible for the symptoms of PMS. Other risk factors associated with PMS include having a family history of depression, anxiety disorders and/or PMS; being underweight; and smoking cigarettes. Women who are overweight and those who have high levels of estrogen in their bodies may also be more likely to experience PMS.", "Premenstrual syndrome, commonly known as PMS, is a group of physical and emotional symptoms that some women experience before menstruation begins. These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can interfere with daily life activities such as working, studying, sleeping and enjoying time with family and friends. The symptoms of PMS can include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, headaches, irritability and depression.
