In addition, the doctor may perform a urinalysis to check for protein in the urine, which is another sign of kidney damage.", "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that affects the kidneys' ability to filter waste products from the body. It is important to treat this condition early because it can lead to end-stage renal disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Treatment for chronic kidney disease depends on the stage of the disease. In the early stages, treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease. In later stages, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease.", "Chronic kidney disease occurs when the kidneys lose function over time. It is a progressive disease that gets worse over time. The most common cause of chronic kidney disease is diabetes. Other causes include high blood pressure, polycystic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, obstructive uropathy, inherited diseases and certain drugs.", "Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed based on the results of a blood test that measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism. When the kidneys are not functioning properly, creatinine levels rise. The stage of kidney disease is determined by the amount of creatinine in the blood. Stage 1 is defined as having a creatinine level between 1.0 and 1.4 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood. Stage 2 is defined as having a creatinine level between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL. Stage 3 is defined as having a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.0 mg/dL.

Other symptoms include diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, headache, irritability, insomnia, mental confusion, memory loss, numbness and tingling in the extremities, and changes in behavior.", "Pellagra is a deficiency disease caused by a lack of niacin (vitamin B3) in the diet. It was first described in 1915 by Dr. Joseph Goldberger, who found that it was associated with a poor diet consisting of cornmeal and little else. Niacin is important because it helps the body convert food into energy. Without enough niacin, the body cannot produce enough energy to function properly. As a result, the body breaks down its own tissues to obtain the necessary energy. This results in the classic signs of pellagra: dermatitis (skin rash), dementia and diarrhea.", "Pellagra is a niacin deficiency disorder that results in dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. It is caused by a lack of niacin, or vitamin B3, in the diet. Niacin is found in many foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, peanuts, leafy vegetables and yeast.
