People who have difficulty swallowing should eat soft foods or use a syringe or feeding tube.", "Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, which causes an increase in bone and soft tissue. In most cases, the cause is benign tumors on the pituitary gland that secrete too much growth hormone. These tumors are called adenomas, and they can be either functioning or non-functioning. The most common type of tumor is called a pituitary adenoma.", "The most common symptom of acromegaly is a large head, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. A person with this condition may also have enlarged hands and feet, as well as thickened skin on the face and neck. Other symptoms include excessive sweating, joint pain, fatigue, and muscle cramps.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone. A doctor will usually order blood tests to look for elevated levels of growth hormone. In addition, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can be done to look at the pituitary gland and determine if there are tumors present. The MRI can also show if the tumors have spread to other areas of the body, such as the liver or spleen.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone, and this can cause problems with the face, hands, feet and other parts of the body. A doctor will typically recommend surgery to remove the tumor or to stop the production of growth hormone. The surgery may be followed by radiation therapy, which can help reduce the size of the tumor. Other treatments may include medication to lower the amount of growth hormone in the bloodstream.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone. In this case, the bones in the face, hands and feet grow larger than normal. This condition can also cause diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis and other health problems. People with this condition will have to take medication to lower the levels of growth hormone in their body.", "The prognosis for someone with acromegaly depends on whether it is treated. In untreated cases, the disease progresses and leads to serious complications, such as diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea and carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment can control the condition and prevent complications from occurring, but it may not cure the disease.", "Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed through a pelvic exam, and the doctor will perform a pelvic exam to look for signs of vaginal discharge. A sample of the discharge will also be taken for testing to confirm the diagnosis.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The main symptom of this condition is a strong fishy odor from the vagina. Other symptoms include white, gray or green vaginal discharge that may be watery or thin and have a strong odor. Women with this condition often experience itching or burning in the vagina, but some women do not experience any symptoms at all.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The condition can cause a variety of symptoms, including abnormal discharge and odor. The best treatment for BV is antibiotics, which are typically prescribed to treat the infection. Antibiotics can be taken in pill form or as a vaginal cream or gel. It's important to take all of the medicine as prescribed.", "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition that affects up to one-third of women in the United States. It's caused by an imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the vagina. The most common symptoms of BV are a fishy odor, abnormal discharge and itching. Other symptoms include burning when urinating or having sex, pain during intercourse and bleeding between periods. Women with BV may also have a higher risk of getting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.", "Bacterial vaginosis can lead to serious health complications, including preterm birth and an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. Vaginosis also increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection of the reproductive organs that can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus).", "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is caused by an imbalance in the natural bacteria that live in the vagina. The condition can be prevented by avoiding douching, which can disrupt the normal balance of vaginal bacteria. Women should also avoid using perfumed products, such as soap, deodorant and scented pads or tampons, in the genital area. Women who have sex with women are more likely to develop BV, so they should take care to use condoms and dental dams during sexual activity.", "Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures. A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled movement or change in behavior caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There are many types of seizures, but they all share these symptoms: sudden muscle stiffening or jerking, loss of consciousness, and confusion afterward. The type of seizure you have depends on where in your brain the abnormal electrical activity is occurring. Seizures can also be caused by a stroke or head injury.", "Epilepsy can be diagnosed with a medical history and physical exam, but the most important part of the diagnostic process is an electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG measures electrical activity in the brain. A computer records this activity and produces a tracing that can show whether seizures are occurring. An EEG may also show what type of seizure is occurring and if there are any other problems with the brain. In some cases, the doctor may also order blood tests, imaging studies or a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to rule out other conditions.", "Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures. A seizure is a sudden change in brain activity, which may cause symptoms like convulsions, loss of consciousness, changes in vision, or loss of bladder control. There are many different types of seizures and each type has a different treatment plan. The most common type of treatment for epilepsy is medication. Medications can be used to stop or prevent seizures, but they do not cure the condition. Surgery is another option for treating epilepsy, and it is often used when other treatments have failed.", "Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The exact cause of this abnormal activity is unknown, but it is believed to be due to a variety of factors, including genetics, head injuries and stroke. Seizures can also be triggered by certain medications or medical conditions such as diabetes, low blood sugar and high blood pressure.", "It is important to have regular checkups with a doctor, and follow the treatment plan as prescribed. A person should also keep a record of seizures, including how long they last and what happens during them. This can help doctors understand if the current medication is working or if there needs to be a change in the treatment plan. People should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if they are taking anti-seizure medications.", "Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures. A person with epilepsy has abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which results in seizures. Seizures can cause a wide range of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, uncontrolled body movements and convulsions. People with epilepsy may experience these symptoms when they are asleep or awake. The severity of seizures varies from person to person, but most people with epilepsy do not have any long-term problems. Some people may need medication to control their seizures.", "Pleural effusion occurs when fluid builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. The pleura is a membrane that covers the outside of the lungs. When the pleura becomes inflamed, fluid can leak into the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This causes the lungs to become swollen, which can make it difficult for a person to breathe.", "Pleural effusion can be diagnosed with a chest X-ray, ultrasound and CT scan. A chest X-ray is often the first test that will be done to look for pleural effusion. Ultrasound is usually the next test performed if the chest X-ray shows an effusion. If the ultrasound does not show the cause of the fluid, then a CT scan may be ordered.", "Common symptoms of pleural effusion include shortness of breath and a cough. A person with pleural effusion may also experience chest pain, especially when they take a deep breath or cough. Pleural effusions are typically caused by conditions that affect the lungs and the membranes surrounding the lungs.", "Pleural effusion occurs when fluid builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. The main cause is heart failure, but it can also be caused by lung disease or cancer.", "The most common treatment for pleural effusion is a thoracentesis, which involves placing a needle in the chest wall and removing fluid from around the lungs. In some cases, a procedure called a paracentesis may be used to drain fluid from the abdomen. If the fluid is not drained, the patient may experience shortness of breath and pain, and may develop an infection in the pleural cavity.", "The most common treatment for pleural effusion is a thoracentesis, which involves draining the fluid from around the lungs. A chest tube is often placed to allow the fluid to drain out of the body. Other treatments include antibiotics to fight infection and medication to reduce inflammation. In some cases, surgery is needed to drain the fluid or remove the fluid-producing organ.", "Pancreatic cancer is often asymptomatic in its early stages, but when it becomes more advanced, it can cause a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: weight loss, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, diarrhea and constipation. Other symptoms may include fatigue, fever, back pain, headaches, fatigue, bloating and diabetes.", "Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose because its early signs are often non-specific and do not appear until the disease has progressed. A person may experience nausea, weight loss, indigestion, fatigue and abdominal pain. The doctor will usually order blood tests and imaging studies such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If a mass is detected, a biopsy of the tumor may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.", "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and can be difficult to treat. In the early stages, treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be recommended. If the cancer has spread beyond the pancreas, chemotherapy is usually the preferred treatment.", "The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach that helps to break down and digest food. It produces two main hormones, insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels. The pancreas also produces enzymes that help digest fats, carbohydrates and proteins.\nThe pancreas can be affected by many diseases, including diabetes, pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. People with diabetes do not produce enough insulin or have problems using insulin, and their blood sugar levels are too high.
