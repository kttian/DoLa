This may involve the use of drugs such as aspirin, heparin, or thrombolytics, as well as surgery or other procedures."}, "What are some major risk factors for stroke?": {"generation": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and the leading cause of disability. There are many risk factors for stroke, including high blood pressure, smoking, being overweight, having a family history of stroke, and having certain diseases such as diabetes or heart disease. Risk factors can also include having had a previous stroke, having atrial fibrillation or heart attack, and using illegal drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamines. Other risk factors include being female and being older than 65 years of age."}, "What differences are there between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke?": {"generation": "An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel carrying oxygen to the brain becomes blocked. A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing blood to leak out into the surrounding tissues. Both strokes can result in damage to the brain, and can cause loss of function. The main difference is that an ischemic stroke can cause damage to the brain because it's not receiving enough blood flow. In a hemorrhagic stroke, damage is caused when too much blood enters the brain."}, "How can one reduce their risk of suffering a stroke?": {"generation": "Reducing your risk of suffering a stroke is important, because strokes are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 15 million people die each year from strokes, accounting for about 28% of all deaths globally. Stroke occurs when a blood vessel carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain either becomes blocked or bursts. If the blockage lasts longer than five minutes, it can cause brain damage. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes and being overweight. It's also important to control stress, get plenty of sleep and exercise regularly."}}, "Insomnia": {"What are the symptoms of insomnia?": {"generation": "Insomnia is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep.

Rest, oxygen and acetazolamide are also used to treat altitude sickness."}, "What causes altitude sickness?": {"generation": "Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness, occurs when the body cannot adjust to lower amounts of oxygen at high altitudes. As altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, and less oxygen is available in each breath. When people reach a certain elevation, their bodies produce substances to help with this decrease in oxygen levels. If a person ascends too rapidly, his or her body may not have time to adjust to the change in oxygen levels, and altitude sickness can result."}, "Can altitude sickness become severe or life-threatening?": {"generation": "Yes. In rare cases, altitude sickness can progress to a serious or life-threatening condition. This is known as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), both of which can occur at elevations greater than 2,500 meters above sea level. HACE can occur within 48 hours of arriving at a high altitude and is marked by confusion and delirium. It is more likely to occur in those with chronic lung disease and/or heart problems. HAPE occurs when fluid collects in the lungs and can cause respiratory distress and shortness of breath. HAPE occurs within 24 to 36 hours of arrival at a high altitude."}, "How quickly can symptoms of altitude sickness appear after ascending to a high altitude?": {"generation": "The symptoms of altitude sickness can appear anywhere from 24 hours to 2 days after ascending to high altitudes.

Mental problems such as delusions and hallucinations."}, "What causes Pellagra?": {"generation": "Pellagra is a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin B3, or niacin, which is found in meat and other animal products. It is most commonly seen in malnourished populations, such as those living in poverty in underdeveloped countries. In these regions, diets tend to consist of corn and rice, which are not good sources of vitamin B3. As a result, many people in these communities develop pellagra."}, "How is Pellagra treated?": {"generation": "The primary treatment for pellagra is to increase vitamin B3 (niacin) intake. This can be done by increasing consumption of foods rich in niacin or taking a niacin supplement. Niacin deficiency is extremely rare in developed nations due to fortification of many staple foods."}, "What dietary changes can help prevent Pellagra?": {"generation": "Pellagra is caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3) in the diet. It was once a common problem in the U.S., especially among poor populations, but it is now rare because of fortified grains, flours and cornmeal. To avoid developing this disease, individuals should make sure to eat plenty of foods high in niacin, such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs, legumes and whole grains. They should also try to limit the consumption of alcohol, as this can lead to a niacin deficiency."}, "Which vitamin deficiency leads to Pellagra?": {"generation": "Niacin deficiency, also known as Pellagra, is a condition that results from a lack of niacin, also called vitamin B3. It was first described in 1905, in Argentina, where it was found that poorly fed people suffered from skin disorders, diarrhea and mental problems. In 1937, the American Journal of Dermatology reported the case of a woman who developed all of these symptoms due to her dietary intake of cornmeal, which contains no niacin. Niacin is found in meats, fish, eggs and whole grains, so those who eat a balanced diet rarely develop Pellagra."}, "What are the complications if Pellagra is left untreated?": {"generation": "If Pellagra is left untreated, it can result in a wide variety of health problems. These include mental confusion, depression, dermatitis, diarrhea and anemia. Additionally, individuals suffering from Pellagra are at risk of developing heart disease.

Symptoms of varicose veins include swelling, heaviness and achiness in the legs, skin discoloration and itching, and sometimes ulcers or sores on the legs. If left untreated, varicose veins can lead to leg cramps, leg ulcers and venous insufficiency, which occurs when the veins cannot return blood to the heart."}, "What treatment options are available for varicose veins?": {"generation": "Treatment for varicose veins depends on the severity of the problem. In cases where the veins are not causing any problems, treatment is not necessary. However, if the veins are causing discomfort or pain, a medical professional can provide a number of different treatments. These include sclerotherapy, laser therapy and endovenous thermal ablation. In cases where the veins are very large, the medical professional may recommend a procedure called stripping and ligation. This procedure involves cutting out and tying off the vein so that it cannot return blood to the heart."}, "What are the risk factors for developing varicose veins?": {"generation": "Varicose veins occur when the valves inside the veins no longer work properly. When this happens, the vein cannot return blood back to the heart, so the blood pools in the veins and causes them to swell. There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing varicose veins. These include obesity, pregnancy, family history of varicose veins, smoking, age and occupations that require prolonged standing or sitting."}, "How can one prevent varicose veins?": {"generation": "Varicose veins can be prevented with lifestyle changes that promote circulation in the legs. These include walking regularly, wearing comfortable shoes and not sitting or standing in the same position for long periods of time. It is also important to lose weight if you are overweight.

In rare cases, cellulitis can be life-threatening, so it's important to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms develop."}, "How is cellulitis typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Cellulitis is diagnosed based on a physical examination and the patient's symptoms. In many cases, a doctor will be able to diagnose cellulitis simply by looking at a patient's skin. However, some cases may require lab tests to confirm the diagnosis. If cellulitis is suspected, the doctor will likely perform a physical examination and check for signs of swelling, tenderness and redness on the patient's skin."}, "What are the common treatments for cellulitis?": {"generation": "Cellulitis is treated with antibiotics and, sometimes, anti-inflammatory drugs. The specific antibiotic used will depend on the organism causing the infection and whether there is any risk of allergy or drug interaction. It is important to follow the prescribed treatment course, even if the symptoms seem to improve earlier than expected. Some cases of cellulitis may require hospitalization."}, "How does cellulitis spread within the body?": {"generation": "Cellulitis spreads by entering the body through breaks in the skin, such as cuts or scrapes. Once the bacteria enter the body, it travels through the lymphatic system until it reaches the bloodstream. At that point, it can travel throughout the body and infect any organ or tissue. This can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the heart. If this happens, the person may experience difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and even shock."}, "What are some risk factors for developing cellulitis?": {"generation": "Cellulitis, a serious bacterial skin infection, is most likely to affect those who have a compromised immune system, poor circulation, or chronic skin problems. Diabetics are especially vulnerable, since elevated glucose levels can impair blood flow, causing damage to the nerves and blood vessels that protect against bacteria. Other risk factors include recent injury to the affected area, obesity, alcoholism, smoking and the use of corticosteroids. Cellulitis may also develop following a burn or surgical wound, as these areas may not heal normally."}, "Can lifestyle changes help in preventing cellulitis?": {"generation": "Cellulitis can be prevented through a few simple lifestyle changes, such as washing your hands often, avoiding scratching and picking at scabs or cuts, and using good hygiene techniques. You should also wear loose, breathable clothing, especially during hot weather. Keeping your body clean and dry can also help prevent cellulitis, as can wearing shoes and socks that fit properly.

The first step is a thorough physical exam, during which your doctor will examine any rashes, sores or ulcers. Your doctor will also take a complete medical history, including a family history of vasculitis. Lab tests, such as a blood test called an ANCA, can confirm a vasculitis diagnosis. In addition, your doctor may perform imaging tests to look at your blood vessels and assess blood flow. Imaging tests may include X-ray, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, angiograms, biopsies, and electrocardiograms (ECG)."}, "What are the treatment options for Vasculitis?": {"generation": "Treatment depends on the type of vasculitis a person has and how severe it is. Most cases of vasculitis are treated with medications that suppress the immune system. These drugs are known as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and they work by reducing the activity of the immune system and limiting inflammation. Other medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may be prescribed for pain relief. In some cases, antibiotics may be used to treat an infection caused by vasculitis. If the disease affects the skin, topical creams may be applied. If the disease affects the joints, rest and physical therapy may be recommended. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected tissue or organs."}, "What causes Vasculitis?": {"generation": "There are many causes of vasculitis, including immune system disorders, infections and certain drugs. In some cases, the cause is unknown. The symptoms of vasculitis are caused by inflammation in the blood vessels and include fever, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, rash and muscle weakness."}, "What are the potential complications of Vasculitis?": {"generation": "Vasculitis, an autoimmune disorder, can be serious and potentially fatal. It occurs when the immune system attacks the blood vessels. If the immune system damages too many blood vessels, it can affect organs throughout the body, causing organ damage and even death. Vasculitis can occur anywhere in the body. Common sites of involvement are the joints, skin, muscles and internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs, heart and nervous system. Complications of vasculitis include inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) that can damage organs and lead to tissue death, anemia (low red blood cell count) and low platelet counts, and in some cases, kidney failure."}, "How can lifestyle changes help manage Vasculitis?": {"generation": "Lifestyle changes can be very helpful in managing vasculitis.

If you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe medications to help control your symptoms."}}, "Goitre": {"What are the symptoms of a goitre?": {"generation": "Goitres are enlarged thyroid glands. Goitre is most commonly caused by a deficiency of iodine in the diet, and this is known as simple goitre. However, goitre may also be caused by Grave's disease or cancerous tumors of the thyroid. Symptoms of simple goitre include swelling of the neck and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of goitre may include hoarseness of voice, weight gain, and trouble swallowing."}, "How is a goitre diagnosed?": {"generation": "Goitres can be diagnosed by a physical examination or through imaging tests such as ultrasounds or x-rays. In some cases, a doctor may order a thyroid function test to help determine whether a goitre is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous)."}, "What treatments are available for a goitre?": {"generation": "Goiter is the medical term used to describe an enlarged thyroid gland, which can cause a noticeable swelling at the base of the neck. Treatment of a goiter depends on its cause. If the goiter is due to a noncancerous growth, the doctor may simply monitor it closely. However, if a goiter is caused by hyperthyroidism, treatment may involve radioactive iodine to shrink the gland. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove all or part of the thyroid gland."}, "What causes a goitre to develop?": {"generation": "The development of a goitre is usually due to a hormonal imbalance in the body. The thyroid gland produces two important hormones, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. If these hormone levels are too high, this results in hyperthyroidism and the production of too many thyroid hormones. In this case, a goitre may develop. On the other hand, if the thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough hormones, a goitre will develop, resulting in hypothyroidism."}, "What are some risk factors for developing a goitre?": {"generation": "Some risk factors for developing a goitre include thyroid nodules, excessive iodine consumption, family history and having a family member with a goitre, and autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis or Graves\u2019 disease. In addition, women are at higher risk than men because of their smaller size and higher levels of estrogen, which slows down thyroid hormone production. Other risk factors include having certain medical conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, as well as exposure to radiation therapy to the head or neck region."}, "What lifestyle adjustments can help manage a goitre?": {"generation": "A goitre can be managed with diet and exercise changes, medication, surgery and iodine supplements. Lifestyle adjustments such as reducing the intake of salt can reduce the amount of thyroid hormone produced in the body. Reducing stress can also be beneficial, as high levels of stress can trigger an increase in thyroid hormone production. It is important to maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. In addition, it is recommended to participate in regular aerobic exercise."}}, "Cardiomyopathy": {"What is cardiomyopathy?": {"generation": "Cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick or stiff, and is unable to pump blood effectively. In some cases, the heart chambers stretch and thin, and the heart cannot relax properly between contractions. As a result, the heart can no longer pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. There are many different types of cardiomyopathy, each with its own set of signs and symptoms. Common types include dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and restrictive cardiomyopathy."}, "What are the different types of cardiomyopathy?": {"generation": "Cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened or rigid, and therefore cannot pump blood effectively throughout the body. There are several types of cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic, dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs when the walls of the heart thicken, causing the heart to become stiff. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by the heart becoming enlarged and weakened. Restrictive cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle stiffens and cannot relax properly, so less blood can be pumped out of the heart."}, "What are the symptoms of cardiomyopathy?": {"generation": "Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can affect all parts of the heart, but is often limited to one chamber. In some cases, cardiomyopathy causes the heart muscle to enlarge, but in others, it becomes rigid.

It is estimated that 17 million Americans have acne at any given time, and approximately 90% of those affected are teenagers."}}, "Sickle cell disease": {"What are the primary symptoms of sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "The symptoms of sickle cell disease include painful episodes (crises) that occur intermittently, fatigue, anemia (low red blood cells), jaundice, and swelling of the hands and feet. In some individuals, the disease progresses slowly, and symptoms are not apparent until adulthood. Other individuals may experience acute chest syndrome, in which the lungs become infected, causing fever and shortness of breath."}, "How is sickle cell disease diagnosed?": {"generation": "Sickle cell disease is diagnosed through a blood test that measures the percentage of hemoglobin S in red blood cells. The hemoglobin S molecule is shaped differently than normal hemoglobin, causing it to distort into a \"sickled\" shape, which can damage the blood vessels and block blood flow. If your child has any signs of sickle cell disease, talk to your doctor."}, "What are the potential treatments for sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "Treatment of sickle cell disease varies according to the type of sickle cell disease. Most individuals with sickle cell disease need to take penicillin every day to help prevent bacterial infections, and some may need to take folic acid. Pain relief is another important part of treatment. It is important to try to control the pain because it can interfere with daily activities and sleep. This can be done through non-opioid drugs, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and opioids, if necessary. Some people may benefit from antibiotics to prevent infections, blood transfusions to improve oxygen levels and reduce pain and anemia, or a stem cell transplant."}, "How does sickle cell disease affect daily life?": {"generation": "The main effects of sickle cell disease are related to anemia, or low levels of red blood cells. Anemia can make individuals feel weak and tired. Painful crises can also occur when the blood flow through sickle shaped red blood cells becomes blocked, causing a lack of oxygen. These crises can be very painful and can last for hours to days. They can happen at any time, and sometimes happen frequently. Some people have milder forms of the disease that don't cause many problems, but others can have serious health complications."}, "What are the risk factors for inheriting sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "The most common risk factor for inheriting sickle cell disease is being born to parents who carry the sickle cell trait. Sickle cell disease is caused by a defect in the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Individuals who inherit the trait from both parents do not have sickle cell disease themselves, but are carriers. They may pass the sickle cell trait onto their children."}, "What are some strategies for managing the symptoms of sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "Strategies for managing sickle cell disease symptoms include maintaining good hydration, taking medications as prescribed, eating a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise.

Other options for treating ovarian cancer include radiation therapy, targeted therapy and hormone therapy. In some cases, doctors may recommend a combination of these treatments."}, "How does ovarian cancer affect the body?": {"generation": "Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological cancers. It begins in the ovaries and can spread throughout the pelvis, abdomen and even the lungs. Ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at later stages than many other cancers, which makes it difficult to treat. This disease can be hard to detect because its early symptoms are similar to those of less serious conditions. As a result, many women with ovarian cancer don't seek treatment until it is too late. The five-year survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is 45 percent."}, "What are some risk factors of ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "Women with a family history of breast, ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer have a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than women without such a history. Other risk factors for ovarian cancer include a personal history of breast or endometrial cancer, infertility, and using fertility drugs. In addition, obese women have a higher risk of ovarian cancer than women of normal weight."}, "Are there any preventative measures for ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "The only known risk factor for ovarian cancer is being female and having two or more full-term pregnancies. Therefore, there is no evidence-based way to prevent ovarian cancer. However, women who have had breast cancer and are at high risk for ovarian cancer should consider using birth control pills or undergoing a prophylactic oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries) to reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer."}}, "Influenza": {"What are the common symptoms of influenza?": {"generation": "Common symptoms of influenza include fever, headache, chills and muscle aches. Influenza, also known as the flu, is caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory tract and causes swelling in the throat, nose and sinuses. It can also cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

This can result in symptoms like thickened lips, tongue or jaw; enlarged nose or ears; deepened voice; and large hands and feet. In addition, individuals with acromegaly may experience vision problems and headaches. Other symptoms of this condition include excess sweating and flushing, as well as joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome."}, "How is acromegaly diagnosed?": {"generation": "Acromegaly is diagnosed by measuring levels of growth hormone in the blood, as well as determining if growth hormone is being produced by the body. The diagnosis may be made using a blood sample or with imaging studies, such as a CT scan, MRI, or a bone scan. In some cases, a biopsy of the tumor is performed to confirm the diagnosis."}, "What treatment options are available for acromegaly?": {"generation": "The goal of treatment is to normalize hormone levels, and this is done through surgery to remove the tumor, medications or radiation therapy. If a tumor cannot be removed or destroyed, the doctor may prescribe medication to lower hormone levels. These medications are used to control growth of the tumor."}, "What complications can occur from acromegaly?": {"generation": "Acromegaly can cause many complications, including hypertension, sleep apnea, and heart disease. It can also affect the teeth and jaw, causing changes to the mouth and face. In addition, people who have acromegaly are at increased risk of developing colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer."}, "What is the prognosis for someone with acromegaly?": {"generation": "The prognosis for someone with acromegaly depends on several factors, including the amount of time it takes to diagnose and treat the condition. Generally, acromegaly is not fatal, but if not treated early enough, it can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes and heart disease. Treating acromegaly usually involves taking medication to lower the levels of growth hormone in the body. If this doesn't work, surgery may be necessary. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used."}}, "Bacterial vaginosis": {"How is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on a woman's medical history and symptoms, along with a physical examination. Women with symptoms such as vaginal discharge, vaginal odor and vaginal itching are at high risk for bacterial vaginosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed using a cotton swab test that detects an increase of certain bacteria in the vagina. In some cases, a sample of vaginal discharge may be collected to send to a lab for testing."}, "What are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis is a very common vaginal infection. Its symptoms may include a strong fish-like odor, thin white or gray vaginal discharge and burning during urination. The symptoms may also be accompanied by irritation of the vagina and vulva (the outer lips of the vagina) and sometimes fever. If these symptoms persist, it is best to visit a health care provider."}, "What treatment is generally recommended for bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis is a bacterial infection of the vagina, which is characterized by thin white discharge. In most cases, the infection clears up on its own without treatment. If treatment is necessary, antibiotics can be prescribed to help kill off the bacteria causing the infection. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions exactly for treatment, since some antibiotics can cause yeast infections or make your condition worse if not taken properly."}, "What can cause bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal balance of bacteria in the vagina is thrown off, allowing harmful bacteria to grow and take over the area. There are many things that can cause this imbalance, including sexual intercourse with multiple partners, using an intrauterine device, douching, smoking and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases."}, "What complications can occur if bacterial vaginosis is not treated?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, can lead to serious complications if it is not treated. If left untreated, BV can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. PID occurs when the infection moves up to a woman's reproductive organs, while infertility results from scarring of the fallopian tubes. In addition, untreated BV increases the risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Women who have had BV once are at increased risk of having it again."}, "How can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis can be prevented by practicing good hygiene habits such as washing the vagina and the surrounding skin with plain water every day and not douching. Women who are sexually active should always use condoms during intercourse to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, which can increase the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis."}}, "Epilepsy": {"What are the symptoms of epilepsy?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by seizures that cannot be attributed to another cause. Seizures may involve a change in behavior, consciousness, or movement, and are often accompanied by temporary changes in vision, hearing or smell. These episodes may last from a few seconds to several minutes. Some individuals experience only a single seizure during their lifetime, while others may experience hundreds."}, "How is epilepsy diagnosed?": {"generation": "In most cases, epilepsy is diagnosed by a neurologist, who will take a detailed history and conduct a physical examination. He or she may also perform tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or computerized tomography (CT scan). An EEG records the electrical activity of the brain. The CT scan can show structural problems in the brain, such as tumors or malformations. If seizures are not controlled with anti-seizure medication, the doctor may recommend a procedure called vagus nerve stimulation. This involves implanting a pacemaker-like device under the skin of the chest, which sends electrical impulses to the brain via the vagus nerve."}, "What treatments are available for epilepsy?": {"generation": "Treatment for epilepsy depends on the type of seizure and the severity of the condition. Medication is the main treatment for most forms of epilepsy. Anticonvulsant drugs help control seizures in most patients. Some drugs work better than others for specific types of seizures. If a person experiences side effects or the drug is not effective, the doctor may change the prescription or try another type of medicine. In some cases, surgery may be an option. If medications don't control the seizures, surgery may help remove the part of the brain causing the seizures."}, "What can trigger an epileptic seizure?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that is characterized by recurring seizures. Seizures may occur at any time during a person's lifetime and can be triggered by many factors. These triggers can be categorized into three main categories: physical, emotional and environmental. Physical triggers include lack of sleep, fatigue, high fever, and intense exercise. Emotional triggers include stress, fear, grief and depression. Environmental triggers include bright lights, loud noises, flashing lights, alcohol and certain foods."}, "What lifestyle changes may help manage epilepsy?": {"generation": "Lifestyle changes can help manage epilepsy and make seizures less likely. These include avoiding stress, getting enough sleep and exercising regularly. Limiting alcohol intake and not smoking can also help."}, "How does epilepsy affect daily life?": {"generation": "Epilepsy can have a wide range of effects on daily life, depending on the type and severity of seizures, the frequency of seizures and the effectiveness of the treatment. Some individuals with epilepsy may be able to live normal lives without any disruption to their daily activities. Other individuals may have frequent seizures that interfere with their ability to work and participate in daily activities."}}, "Pleural effusion": {"What is pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up in the space between the lungs and chest wall, causing pressure on the lungs and difficulty breathing. It can occur on its own, or as a result of another disease. The most common cause is cancer. Other causes include autoimmune disorders, infections and trauma. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but it can involve draining the excess fluid, administering diuretics and/or treating the underlying disease."}, "How is pleural effusion diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion is usually diagnosed using a chest x-ray. If there is fluid on the outside of the lungs, it will appear white on the x-ray. In some cases, a CT scan may be used to diagnose pleural effusion. A CT scan can help determine if there are any other problems in the chest besides the fluid buildup. Pleural effusion may be diagnosed during a routine physical examination. During this procedure, a doctor will tap on the chest and listen for abnormal sounds that indicate fluid buildup. If pleural effusion is suspected, a doctor may order a chest x-ray and a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis."}, "What are the common symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid between the layers of the lining that surrounds the lungs (the pleura). Common symptoms include shortness of breath and a sharp chest pain that gets worse when lying down. Pleural effusion occurs more frequently in people with heart failure or lung cancer, and may also be seen in those with rheumatoid arthritis or cirrhosis of the liver."}, "What are some potential causes of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up around the lungs. There are many reasons why this happens, but it usually occurs because the lung's membranes are irritated or inflamed. Some of the possible causes include: 1. Infections: Pneumonia, tuberculosis, influenza, and other infections can cause the pleura to swell and fill with fluid. 2. Lung cancer: Malignancies in the lung, such as non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, can cause pleural effusions. 3. Other cancers: Some cancers, such as breast cancer, can spread to the lungs and cause pleural effusions. 4. Pulmonary embolism: When a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to the lungs, this can cause the pleura to fill with fluid. 5. Heart failure: If the heart cannot"}, "What are the treatments available for pleural effusion?": {"generation": "The first line of treatment for pleural effusion is to identify and treat the underlying cause. If this is not possible, then drainage of the pleural fluid may be necessary. The two main methods of draining pleural fluid are thoracentesis and pleurodesis. Thoracentesis is a procedure where the fluid is drained from the chest cavity using a needle inserted through the chest wall. Pleurodesis is a procedure where a chemical is used to adhere the lining of the lung to the inside of the chest wall. This prevents further accumulation of fluid in the space between the lung and the chest wall."}, "How can one manage the symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid accumulates between the membranes that line the chest cavity (pleura) and lungs. The fluid can cause chest pain, shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but can include medication, drainage of the fluid, and sometimes, surgery. Medications can help decrease the amount of fluid in the chest and decrease the pressure on the lungs, allowing them to work more effectively. If the cause of the pleural effusion cannot be controlled, draining the fluid through a needle can provide relief. In some cases, the excess fluid must be drained surgically, and this procedure is known as thoracentesis."}}, "Pancreatic cancer": {"What are the common symptoms of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "The most common symptom of pancreatic cancer is abdominal pain, but there are many other possible signs and symptoms of this disease. These can include weight loss, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dark urine, light-colored stools, and diabetes."}, "How is pancreatic cancer typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is diagnosed by imaging tests like computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These tests can help identify any growths or masses in the pancreas, which could indicate cancer. Doctors will also look for signs of jaundice or elevated liver enzymes, as these are also indicators of pancreatic cancer. If the doctor suspects cancer, a biopsy will be performed. In some cases, biopsies can be done through a needle that's inserted into the pancreas during imaging tests. However, this method isn't always effective. Instead, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the tumor and determine if the cancer has spread."}, "What treatments are available for pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is a very difficult disease to treat because the cancer cells are so resistant to standard therapies. Surgery is rarely used to treat this type of cancer, but it is possible to remove the tumor in some cases. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily increase survival, since most patients develop advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. In addition, chemotherapy and radiation are generally used as adjuvant therapies following surgery. These therapies are intended to eliminate any remaining cancer cells that might have been missed during the surgical procedure. The main goal of these therapies is to extend survival and improve quality of life."}, "How does the pancreas function in the body?": {"generation": "The pancreas is located behind the stomach and produces hormones that regulate blood sugar levels as well as enzymes that help the body break down food. It is made up of exocrine tissue, which produces enzymes to aid in digestion, and endocrine tissue, which produces hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer occurs when abnormal cells within the pancreas grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, forming tumors that can spread to other parts of the body."}, "What are some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is more likely to develop in individuals with certain risk factors. These include age, family history and ethnicity, as well as obesity and smoking. Other risk factors for this type of cancer include having diabetes, exposure to chemicals at work, and having had gallstones."}, "Are there known preventive measures to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is a difficult disease to detect early because there are few symptoms, and those that do exist are often mistaken for other conditions. While it is not possible to prevent pancreatic cancer, certain factors may increase your risk of developing the disease. These factors include smoking, obesity and high alcohol intake. People who smoke or drink heavily are at greater risk for developing pancreatic cancer than non-smokers or light drinkers. If you are concerned about your risk for developing pancreatic cancer, talk to your doctor. He or she can advise you on steps that you can take to lower your risk."}}}}
