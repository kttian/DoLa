It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking, obesity, family history, chronic pancreatitis and certain genetic syndromes."}, "Are there known preventive measures to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early because it doesn't usually cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage.
