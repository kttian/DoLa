When the pancreas becomes diseased, the cells in the pancreas can start to grow out of control and form a mass of tissue. The mass is known as a pancreatic neoplasm, and this type of growth is referred to as pancreatic cancer. It is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S., with approximately 53,670 new cases expected this year. Most pancreatic cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when the disease has already spread to other organs in the body. As a result, the five-year survival rate is less than 10 percent. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose, as the pancreas is deep in the abdomen and surrounded by many vital structures."}, "What treatments are available for pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "The first line of treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Sometimes the entire pancreas needs to be removed. In these situations, surgery is not curative, and patients are placed on chemotherapy. This treatment is given intravenously to kill any cancer cells that may have been left behind. A newer drug that targets a protein that promotes the growth of pancreatic cancer is showing great promise and is approved for patients whose disease has recurred. In patients with localized disease, the Whipple procedure is another surgical option that offers good outcomes.
