Other complications that can occur include bone fractures, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, a weakened immune system, and many more."}, "What is the prognosis for someone with acromegaly?": {"generation": "The prognosis for someone with acromegaly depends on whether the condition is caught early and whether it is treated appropriately. Acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. If this tumor is not removed, the patient can develop diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health problems. Surgical removal of the tumor is the only cure for this disease, but patients often need further treatment after surgery. The medical team at NYU Langone may also prescribe hormone replacement therapy and other medications to treat the symptoms and complications of acromegaly."}}, "Bacterial vaginosis": {"How is bacterial vaginosis diagnosed?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed using a combination of clinical examination and laboratory tests. It is important to check for symptoms of bacterial vaginosis such as abnormal discharge, itching and burning. The doctor will use a cotton swab to take a sample of the vaginal discharge and send it to the laboratory for testing."}, "What are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The condition can cause a variety of symptoms, including a fishy odor, white or gray vaginal discharge, and vaginal itching and discomfort. The condition can also cause pain and burning when urinating."}, "What treatment is generally recommended for bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina, which is often accompanied by a strong, fishy smell. BV is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, but it can be spread from person to person through intimate sexual contact. Treatment typically involves an antibiotic, and if it is not cured, it can be treated with a probiotic. People with BV should also avoid using soap in the genital area and should clean the area with a waterless cleanser. Women should also avoid douching, as this may worsen symptoms."}, "What can cause bacterial vaginosis?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The condition can occur at any time, but most often occurs when a woman is in her 20s to 30s and has a new sexual partner. The exact cause of bacterial vaginosis is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of factors, including having sex with a new partner, taking antibiotics, using a diaphragm for birth control, douching, using perfumed products in the vagina and having a history of a sexually transmitted disease."}, "What complications can occur if bacterial vaginosis is not treated?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis can lead to serious complications if it is not treated. If left untreated, this condition can cause bacteria to get into the uterus, cervix, or fallopian tubes. This could lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility. It is also possible for bacterial vaginosis to increase the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or HIV."}, "How can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?": {"generation": "It is recommended to avoid vaginal douching, as it changes the normal balance of vaginal flora and may increase the risk of getting bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is spread through sexual contact. Therefore, it is recommended to use condoms for protection against STDs. It is also recommended to use a spermicidal foam or gel to prevent pregnancy."}}, "Epilepsy": {"What are the symptoms of epilepsy?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures. People with epilepsy may have no seizures, few seizures or numerous seizures that can occur many times per day. Some people with epilepsy also have learning disabilities or behavioral problems."}, "How is epilepsy diagnosed?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a condition that is diagnosed when a person has two or more seizures. However, seizures alone do not necessarily indicate that a person has epilepsy. There are many different types of seizures that can occur. An epileptologist (a physician specializing in the care of people with epilepsy) will review the patient's medical history and may request medical tests to evaluate the patient's condition. Tests may include an electroencephalogram (EEG), a diagnostic tool that records electrical activity in the brain, or an MRI of the brain. The tests will help to determine if the patient's seizures are being caused by a medical condition or by epilepsy."}, "What treatments are available for epilepsy?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a condition that is diagnosed when someone has had at least two seizures. However, not all seizures are the same. There are many different types of seizures, which can be caused by a variety of conditions. The most common types of seizures are called generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which are characterized by a loss of consciousness and shaking of the entire body. There are other types of seizures, such as absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, and atonic seizures, which involve different parts of the body."}, "What can trigger an epileptic seizure?": {"generation": "Epileptic seizures are a result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These seizures can be triggered by a wide range of causes, such as fever, sleep deprivation, alcohol use, head trauma and stroke. Seizures can also be caused by certain medications, such as those used to treat mental health conditions."}, "What lifestyle changes may help manage epilepsy?": {"generation": "It is important to have regular checkups with a primary care physician, as well as neurologists, to evaluate epilepsy and monitor any seizure activity. This may include imaging tests, neurological testing and medications. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise and stress reduction. Getting enough sleep and avoiding alcohol can also help reduce the risk of seizures."}, "How does epilepsy affect daily life?": {"generation": "Epilepsy affects the daily life of both those with the condition and their families. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which people have seizures or periods of unusual behavior, usually caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can be mild or severe and can range from staring blankly into space to full-body convulsions."}}, "Pleural effusion": {"What is pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when the space between the lungs and the chest wall (pleural space) becomes filled with fluid, called pleural effusion. The space between the lungs and the chest wall usually contains a small amount of fluid. If this fluid builds up, it can press on the lungs and make breathing difficult. The fluid can also be caused by an infection in the lungs or in the pleural space. Pleural effusion can be caused by infections such as pneumonia, heart failure, cancer or autoimmune disorders. It can also be caused by an accumulation of lymph fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall. Pleural effusion is a common problem in people who have had a heart attack or stroke. It can be treated with antibiotics or by draining the fluid from the pleural space."}, "How is pleural effusion diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion is often diagnosed with a chest X-ray, a CT scan or an ultrasound. However, if the X-ray shows no abnormalities, or if the cause of the effusion is unclear, additional testing may be needed. These tests can include a thoracentesis, which is a procedure in which a small sample of fluid from the pleural space is removed and tested to see if it contains an infection or cancer. The sample is sent to a lab for testing."}, "What are the common symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Common symptoms of pleural effusion include shortness of breath and a wet cough. These are typically caused by fluid building up in the pleural cavity, the space between the lungs and the chest wall. In some cases, there may be a lump on the front of the chest or the patient may experience a sharp pain when they cough. Other symptoms include fever, weight loss, and shortness of breath even when resting. The diagnosis is made through a chest x-ray."}, "What are some potential causes of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Potential causes of pleural effusion include infection, cancer and heart failure. Pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the lining of the chest and the lungs. The most common cause of pleural effusion is pneumonia, although it can also be caused by certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer, and congestive heart failure."}, "What are the treatments available for pleural effusion?": {"generation": "The most common treatment for pleural effusion is a thoracentesis, a procedure in which the doctor inserts a needle into the chest cavity to remove excess fluid. The fluid can be drained using a needle or a small tube. If a large amount of fluid needs to be removed, a chest tube may be inserted into the chest cavity. This procedure can take several days and will need to be repeated if the fluid builds up again."}, "How can one manage the symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "It is important to have a pleural effusion evaluated by a health care professional. There are many different causes of pleural effusion, and it is important to find out what is causing it. There are different types of pleural effusions, including those caused by fluid build-up and those caused by infections. Depending on the cause, the symptoms will be different, and a person may have symptoms in the chest, abdomen and even the head."}}, "Pancreatic cancer": {"What are the common symptoms of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is often asymptomatic in the early stages and is often diagnosed after imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, have been done to check for other possible conditions. In later stages, some patients may experience symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and vomiting."}, "How is pancreatic cancer typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed after a patient has experienced symptoms, which may include abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because it is often asymptomatic and grows slowly. The patient's medical history, physical examination, CT scan, MRI, endoscopy and biopsy are all used to diagnose pancreatic cancer."}, "What treatments are available for pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is often not curable. However, some patients may be able to have surgery to remove the tumor and have a better chance at survival. If the tumor cannot be removed surgically, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for pancreatic cancer."}, "How does the pancreas function in the body?": {"generation": "The pancreas is a long, narrow gland located behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It produces enzymes that help digest food and hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. In some people, the pancreas can become inflamed and cause pain. The most common causes of this condition are infections and inflammatory diseases of the pancreas, such as pancreatitis. Symptoms of pancreatitis can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Pancreatitis is usually treated with medications, but in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the inflamed pancreas."}, "What are some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer develops when a malignant tumor forms in the pancreas. It is a very serious disease, and one of the main risk factors is tobacco use. People who smoke have a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Other risk factors include obesity, certain genetic mutations, a diet high in red meat, and a diet high in fat and sugar. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age, but it is also possible for younger people to develop this disease."}, "Are there known preventive measures to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "It is recommended to have regular checkups with a primary care physician, especially if you have a family history of pancreatic cancer. This is because there is no screening for pancreatic cancer, so early detection can be difficult. The best way to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer is to maintain a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, and getting regular exercise."}}}}
