These include avoiding alcohol, quitting smoking, getting plenty of rest and eating a healthy diet."}}, "Acromegaly": {"What is the cause of acromegaly?": {"generation": "Acromegaly is a condition that results from excess growth hormone (GH) production. It can be caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The tumor secretes GH and leads to overproduction of this hormone. This causes the bones to grow larger and the soft tissues to enlarge as well."}, "What are the symptoms of acromegaly?": {"generation": "Acromegaly is a condition that causes the body's cells to produce too much growth hormone. This can lead to enlargement of the hands, feet and face. Other symptoms include diabetes, heart disease, joint pain and vision problems. The exact cause of acromegaly is unknown, but it is often associated with tumors in the pituitary gland."}, "How is acromegaly diagnosed?": {"generation": "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone. This can lead to enlargement of the bones in the face, hands and feet. It can also cause the heart to grow larger and increase pressure on the optic nerve, which can lead to vision problems. The symptoms of acromegaly are often subtle and may go unnoticed for years. A doctor will usually order blood tests to check for high levels of growth hormone. If these tests are abnormal, an MRI or CT scan of the pituitary gland may be ordered to look for tumors."}, "What treatment options are available for acromegaly?": {"generation": "Treatment options for acromegaly include surgery, medication and radiation therapy. Surgery is the most common treatment option, but it can be difficult to perform because of the location of the pituitary gland. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor that is causing the excess growth hormone production. Medications such as octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Lanmark) may also be used to treat acromegaly. These drugs block the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. Radiation therapy is another option, but it is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy."}, "What complications can occur from acromegaly?": {"generation": "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone. This causes the bones to grow and thicken, which can lead to problems such as arthritis, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, enlarged heart, high blood pressure, diabetes, vision problems and headaches. It can also cause tumors in the pituitary gland or other parts of the body."}, "What is the prognosis for someone with acromegaly?": {"generation": "The prognosis for people with acromegaly depends on how long they have had the condition and whether or not it has been treated.
