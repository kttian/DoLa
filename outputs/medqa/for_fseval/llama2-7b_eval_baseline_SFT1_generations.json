Treatment will depend on the cause.\nPeople who have hives may be given an antihistamine. An antihistamine can help reduce itching and make the hives less noticeable.\nIt is important to avoid triggers when possible. People who have hives may want to keep a journal of what they eat, medications they take, and where they are when they have hives.

These symptoms may last from 1 to 7 days. In rare cases, some people will have a severe form of dengue fever and develop dengue hemorrhagic fever. This is a potentially life-threatening illness."}, "How is Dengue fever transmitted?": {"generation": "There are two species of the dengue virus which are transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected with the virus by feeding on a person who is infected with the virus. The mosquitoes then can spread the virus to other humans or other animals through the biting process. Dengue fever can also be transmitted from one person to another. This type of transmission occurs through blood transfusion, or in utero."}, "What treatments are available for Dengue fever?": {"generation": "Many people who have Dengue fever will recover without treatment, but severe Dengue fever needs immediate care in a hospital. In patients with severe Dengue fever, the diagnosis can be confirmed with a laboratory test that looks at the person's blood. In less severe cases, the health care provider will make the diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and a physical examination.

Some people may have no symptoms, while others may develop symptoms that make it difficult to carry out daily activities."}, "How is scleroderma typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Many people are diagnosed with scleroderma when they see a rheumatologist, because rheumatologists specialize in diseases that affect the muscles, joints and connective tissue. They will order a complete blood count, a complete metabolic panel, blood chemistries, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an antinuclear antibody test. If a patient has positive results on these tests, the rheumatologist may perform other tests, such as a skin biopsy and biopsy of other tissues. However, a diagnosis is typically based on a patient's symptoms and medical history."}, "What are the available treatments for scleroderma?": {"generation": "Many people are living well with scleroderma, and treatments have advanced to the point where individuals with the disease can live relatively normal lives. There is no cure for the disease, but there are treatments that help reduce the symptoms. Scleroderma is a chronic condition that involves the hardening of the skin and connective tissue. The cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder.

Symptoms usually begin in the feet and legs and can spread to the arms and upper body. In some cases, symptoms will progress quickly, but in other cases, the symptoms may develop slowly. The medical history and physical examination are important in diagnosing the cause of the weakness and pain. However, an electromyogram (EMG) is necessary to help distinguish between Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other conditions with similar symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis or Lyme disease. A spinal tap may also be necessary to rule out infections that could cause similar symptoms."}, "What are the treatment options for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome?": {"generation": "Many people with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome can recover with no medical treatment and do not require hospitalization. However, if someone is having severe symptoms, they may require hospitalization and may be treated with plasma exchange, which involves removing the person's blood and replacing it with donated blood that is free of the antibodies. High doses of steroids may also be used to reduce inflammation in the nerves. The person's muscles may be physically weak, so it is important to be able to move around and get in and out of bed without assistance."}, "How does Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome affect the nervous system?": {"generation": "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a disease that causes the body's immune system to attack the peripheral nervous system, which is the network of nerves that sends signals from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body.

The symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome include tingling, weakness and numbness in the hands and feet. This leads to muscle weakness throughout the body, which is why people may find it difficult to walk or even sit up.

The discharge is white and gray, and has a fishy odor."}, "What complications can occur if bacterial vaginosis is not treated?": {"generation": "Bacterial vaginosis is a common infection of the vagina. It is caused by an imbalance in the bacteria that live in the vagina. This causes an increase in the number of bacteria that normally live in the vagina and can lead to an overgrowth of the bacteria.\nBacterial vaginosis can cause inflammation of the vaginal walls. This can cause a burning or itching sensation. It can also cause a white discharge, and if the condition is not treated it can lead to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV and chlamydia.\nIt is important to get treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent complications."}, "How can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?": {"generation": "Many women are living with the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is an imbalance of vaginal bacteria.\nWomen with BV have increased amounts of certain bacteria in their vaginas, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Mycoplasma hominis, and Prevotella bivia.
