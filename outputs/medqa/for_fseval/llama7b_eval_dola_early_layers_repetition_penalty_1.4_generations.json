It occurs when oil and dead skin cells plug up hair follicles, causing whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Although many cases of acne clear up without treatment, some individuals need help managing their acne. In these cases, topical creams containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid are effective at reducing the number of lesions. Oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines and erythromycin are also helpful in treating acne. If these measures fail, your doctor may prescribe stronger medications, such as retinoids or isotretinoin. Isotretinoin is a powerful drug that works by shrinking sebaceous glands, thereby decreasing the amount of oil produced by the skin."}, "What types of acne are there?": {"generation": "Acne is classified into four main categories based on its location on the body: facial, chest, back and neck. Facial acne occurs on the face and is the most common type of acne. Chest acne appears on the upper chest and shoulders. Back acne affects the lower back and sometimes the upper back. Neck acne occurs on the neck and jawline. Each type of acne has its own characteristics and treatment plan."}, "How does diet affect acne?": {"generation": "Acne is a chronic disorder that occurs when oil and dead skin cells clog pores. Hormones play a role in causing acne, so certain hormonal changes during puberty can trigger breakouts. Dietary factors such as dairy products, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter, eggs, shellfish, wheat, corn, citrus fruits, tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes, bananas, avocados, raspberries, blueberries, cherries, plums, prunes, raisins, figs, dates, coconut, coffee, tea, cola drinks, alcohol, sugar, processed meats, refined grains and trans fatty acids can all contribute to acne. Some studies suggest that eating too much protein can increase sebum production, while others show that high levels of zinc intake can reduce acne."}, "What role does hygiene play in acne?": {"generation": "Hygiene plays a large role in acne because it helps keep pores clean and prevents excess oil production. Acne occurs when dead skin cells and oils combine inside the hair follicles of the skin. When these substances mix together, they create a plug that blocks the opening of the follicle. Bacteria grow within the plugged follicle, causing redness, swelling and irritation. Washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser and using a noncomedogenic moisturizer can help reduce breakouts."}, "Are there any complications related to long-term acne?": {"generation": "Acne is a very common problem among teenagers and young adults. It occurs when oil and dead skin cells plug up hair follicles, causing whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Although acne is not harmful, it can leave scars and discolored patches on the face, chest and back. In some cases, acne can lead to permanent damage to the skin. Scarring can result from picking at lesions, using harsh topical products or having too many procedures done to remove acne. Permanent dark spots can develop due to excessive sun exposure while trying to cover up acne."}}, "Sickle cell disease": {"What are the primary symptoms of sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "The main symptom of sickle cell disease is chronic anemia, which occurs because red blood cells don't live long enough due to the shape of the cells. These cells tend to stick together and block blood flow, causing damage to organs throughout the body. Other symptoms include episodes of pain, fatigue, swelling of hands and feet, frequent infections and delayed growth."}, "How is sickle cell disease diagnosed?": {"generation": "Diagnosis of sickle cell disease begins with a complete medical history and physical examination. During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of anemia, such as pale skin, fatigue and shortness of breath. Your doctor will also check for evidence of organ damage, such as swelling in the hands and feet, eye problems, hearing loss and delayed growth. In addition, your doctor may perform tests to determine the number of red blood cells in your body, the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell and the shape of your red blood cells. These tests help confirm a diagnosis of sickle cell disease."}, "What are the potential treatments for sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder that affects red blood cells. It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the gene that codes for the protein hemoglobin S, instead of just one copy. Inheriting only one copy of the gene results in sickle cell trait, which is not harmful. When both copies of the gene code for hemoglobin S, the body produces abnormal red blood cells that are crescent shaped rather than round. These abnormal cells die early, causing a shortage of red blood cells. As a result, individuals with sickle cell disease experience chronic anemia, fatigue, episodes of pain and organ damage."}, "How does sickle cell disease affect daily life?": {"generation": "Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder that affects red blood cells. It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the gene that codes for the protein hemoglobin S, instead of just one copy. In normal red blood cells, hemoglobin helps carry oxygen throughout the body. But in those with sickle cell disease, the shape of the red blood cells changes into a crescent moon shape. These misshapen cells die early, causing a shortage of red blood cells. As a result, less oxygen reaches the body's organs and tissues, which can lead to organ damage and chronic pain."}, "What are the risk factors for inheriting sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "Inherited diseases such as sickle cell disease are passed down from parents to children through genetic traits. If both parents carry the gene for sickle cell disease, each child has a 25 percent chance of being born with the disease. If only one parent carries the gene, the child has a 50 percent chance of having the disease. If neither parent carries the gene, the child cannot inherit the disease."}, "What are some strategies for managing the symptoms of sickle cell disease?": {"generation": "Managing the symptoms of sickle cell disease depends on what stage of the disease the person is in. In the early stages, individuals may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling and frequent infections. These symptoms can be managed with rest, fluids, oxygen therapy and medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. As the disease progresses, individuals may develop chronic pain, vision problems, ulcers and damage to internal organs. Pain management is key at this point, and many people find relief with opioid analgesics. Other treatments include hydroxyurea, transfusions and iron chelators."}}, "Ovarian cancer": {"What are common symptoms of ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "Common symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pelvic pressure, difficulty eating, frequent urination, fatigue, constipation, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, back pain, pain during intercourse, vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual periods, infertility, weight gain, swelling of the legs, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, dizziness, numbness, weakness, vision changes, hearing changes, dry mouth, sores in the mouth, hair loss, rash, itching, hives, acne, dark patches on the skin, change in bowel habits, rectal bleeding, and/or change in bladder habits."}, "How is ovarian cancer typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those of less serious conditions. In fact, many women don't experience any symptoms until the cancer has progressed significantly. When symptoms do appear, they may include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, frequent urination, constipation or diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, back pain, shortness of breath, swelling in the legs or feet, changes in bowel habits, vaginal discharge, irregular menstrual periods, infertility, weight gain or loss, and breast tenderness. If these symptoms persist, a woman should see her doctor right away."}, "What treatment options are available for ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "Treatment options for ovarian cancer depend on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. In general, early-stage ovarian cancer is treated with surgery alone, while advanced-stage ovarian cancer is treated with surgery plus chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs used to treat ovarian cancer include platinum agents such as cisplatin and taxanes such as paclitaxel. These drugs work by killing rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells. Other chemotherapy drugs used to treat ovarian cancer include gemcitabine, topotecan and liposomal doxorubicin."}, "How does ovarian cancer affect the body?": {"generation": "Ovarian cancer occurs when cells in the ovary grow out of control and form tumors. These tumors can interfere with normal functioning of the ovary and surrounding organs. In some cases, these tumors can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver and intestines. Ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. Common signs and symptoms include bloating, pelvic pain, difficulty eating, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor about possible causes."}, "What are some risk factors of ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "Risk factors for ovarian cancer include age, family history, obesity, infertility, hormone replacement therapy, smoking and certain reproductive factors such as never having children or giving birth at an older age. Women who have had breast cancer, colon cancer or endometrial cancer are also at higher risk for developing ovarian cancer."}, "Are there any preventative measures for ovarian cancer?": {"generation": "Preventative measures for ovarian cancer include having children early in life, using birth control pills and undergoing fertility treatments. Women who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family should consider genetic testing to see if they carry the BRCA gene mutation. If so, they may want to consider prophylactic surgeries such as hysterectomies and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies. These procedures remove the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus, thereby reducing the risk of developing ovarian cancer."}}, "Influenza": {"What are the common symptoms of influenza?": {"generation": "Influenza is characterized by fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, fatigue and sore throat. Some individuals may experience vomiting and/or diarrhea. These symptoms generally last about five days. Complications associated with influenza include sinus problems, ear infections, bronchitis and pneumonia. It is important to note that some people may not show any signs of having the flu, while others may develop very high temperatures and feel extremely sick."}, "How is influenza spread?": {"generation": "Influenza is spread through droplets produced when infected individuals sneeze or cough. These droplets contain the flu virus and can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby. It can also be spread through direct contact with an infected person. Those who come into contact with these droplets or objects that have been touched by an infected person are at risk of contracting the flu."}, "What are the typical treatments for influenza?": {"generation": "Influenza is typically treated with rest, fluids and fever reducers. Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu can shorten the duration of the illness, but these must be started within 48 hours of the first signs of illness. If your doctor prescribes antivirals, make sure to take all doses as directed. It is important to note that antivirals only work if taken early enough in the course of the illness."}, "What types of influenza vaccines are available?": {"generation": "Influenza vaccines come in many forms, including shots, nasal sprays and intradermal needles. Shots are given into muscle, while nasal sprays are administered up the nose. Intradermal needles are used to inject the vaccine just under the skin. All flu vaccines contain dead viruses, so they cannot give you the flu. Flu vaccines protect against three strains of influenza each year. These strains change every year because the virus mutates rapidly. It takes about two weeks for your body to develop immunity to the flu after receiving the vaccine."}, "Which populations are most at risk for severe influenza?": {"generation": "Influenza is a respiratory illness that affects millions of Americans each year. It is especially dangerous for those who are very young or old, pregnant women, individuals with chronic diseases such as asthma, COPD or heart disease, and those with weakened immune systems due to cancer or HIV/AIDS. These groups are at higher risk for developing complications from the flu, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections."}, "How can the spread of influenza be prevented?": {"generation": "Influenza is highly contagious and can be spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. It can also be spread through direct contact with these droplets or by touching objects or surfaces that have been contaminated with flu germs and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. To help prevent the spread of influenza, wash hands frequently, cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoid sharing utensils or drinking glasses. If you suspect you have contracted influenza, stay home until at least 24 hours after your fever subsides without the use of fever-reducing medications."}}, "Prostatitis": {"What are the common symptoms of prostatitis?": {"generation": "Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland. It is classified into four categories based on its cause: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis and occurs suddenly. Common symptoms include fever, chills, burning during urination, frequent urination, lower back pain and discomfort while having sex. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is less common than acute bacterial prostatitis and develops slowly over time. Symptoms include similar ones to those of acute bacterial prostatitis, along with painful ejaculation, difficulty starting urination and pain in the testicles."}, "How is prostatitis usually diagnosed?": {"generation": "Prostatitis is diagnosed based on a physical examination and a discussion about your symptoms. Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms, such as when they started, what makes them better or worse, and any associated symptoms, such as fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. You may need additional tests to rule out other problems, such as a urinalysis, ultrasound, CT scan or MRI."}, "What are the possible treatments for prostatitis?": {"generation": "Prostatitis is diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination findings. If no specific cause is found, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to reduce the risk of recurrence. In some cases, the doctor may perform a biopsy to rule out cancer. Other treatments include alpha blockers, antihistamines, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, muscle relaxants, narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and topical creams."}, "Is prostatitis a chronic condition?": {"generation": "Prostatitis is not considered a chronic condition because it generally resolves within six weeks. However, some cases of acute prostatitis can last longer than six weeks. In these cases, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help clear up the infection. If the infection doesn't go away, the doctor may perform a biopsy to determine what kind of prostate problem the patient has."}, "Which age group is commonly affected by prostatitis?": {"generation": "Prostatitis affects men between 20 and 50 years old. It is rare in men younger than 18 and older than 60. Men who have had sexually transmitted diseases are at higher risk for developing prostatitis."}, "Does lifestyle play a role in the development of prostatitis?": {"generation": "Prostatitis is not related to lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption or sexual activity. It is important to note that some cases of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) may be associated with certain behaviors, such as frequent ejaculation, anal sex or prolonged sitting. These activities may irritate the prostate and contribute to CP/CPPS."}}, "Mumps": {"What are the symptoms of mumps?": {"generation": "Mumps is characterized by swelling of the salivary glands underneath the ears. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. In some cases, menstruating women may experience breast tenderness. Most individuals recover within 10 days without any lasting effects. However, about 25 percent of those infected develop complications such as deafness, orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) and oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries). These complications are rare and generally only affect adult males."}, "How is mumps transmitted?": {"generation": "Mumps is transmitted through saliva, so it is easily passed from person to person via sneezing, coughing or kissing. It is not possible to contract mumps from eating utensils, drinking glasses or door handles. In addition, mumps cannot be transmitted through breast milk or semen."}, "What are the complications of mumps?": {"generation": "Mumps is a viral infection that affects the salivary glands. It is characterized by swelling of the cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. Complications of mumps include meningitis, encephalitis, deafness and orchitis. Meningitis occurs when the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain become infected. Encephalitis is an infection of the brain itself. Deafness is due to damage to the cochlea, the part of the inner ear responsible for hearing. Orchitis is an infection of the testicles. In rare cases, pregnant women who contract mumps during the first trimester of pregnancy risk miscarriage or stillbirth."}, "How can mumps be prevented?": {"generation": "Mumps is a viral infection that is highly contagious and can be spread through saliva or mucus. It is important to note that mumps cannot be spread through casual contact such as shaking hands or hugging. In addition, individuals who have been vaccinated against mumps are still at risk of contracting the disease because immunity only lasts about 10 years. To protect yourself from mumps, make sure your child receives the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. If you think you might have mumps, call your doctor immediately so that you can receive proper treatment."}, "What treatments are available for mumps?": {"generation": "Mumps is a viral infection that affects the salivary glands. It is characterized by swelling of the cheeks and jaw, fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. Most cases of mumps resolve without any specific treatment. Antiviral medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help reduce the discomfort associated with mumps. In some cases, steroids may be used to reduce swelling. If the mumps involve the testicles, the doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications to reduce the risk of infertility."}, "How is mumps diagnosed?": {"generation": "Mumps is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms reported by the patient. It is important to note that some individuals infected with mumps may not show any symptoms at all. In addition, many cases of mumps go undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of other viral infections. If a person suspects that they have been exposed to mumps, they should see a doctor immediately. Testing for mumps is done using a sample of saliva or spinal fluid."}}, "Schizoaffective disorder": {"What are the main symptoms of schizoaffective disorder?": {"generation": "Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by both psychotic features and depression or mania. Psychotic features include hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders and disorganized speech. Depressive episodes can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, guilt and suicidal thoughts. Manic episodes can include increased energy, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, grandiose ideas and impulsivity. These symptoms can fluctuate between periods of normal functioning and periods of psychosis."}, "What steps are involved in diagnosing schizoaffective disorder?": {"generation": "Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder begins with a thorough physical examination and review of the patient's medical history. In addition, mental status testing may be conducted to assess cognitive functioning. Mental status testing may involve asking questions about current events, memory, speech patterns and thought processes. If these tests suggest schizoaffective disorder, additional psychological evaluations may be ordered to determine the presence of hallucinations and delusions. These evaluations may include interviews with family members and friends, as well as observation of behavior during interactions with others."}, "What treatment options exist for schizoaffective disorder?": {"generation": "Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition characterized by psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions along with depression and/or mania. It is important to note that not all individuals with schizoaffective disorder experience both psychosis and mood episodes, so some people only experience one or the other. Treatment depends on the specific needs of each person, but generally includes antipsychotics, antidepressants and possibly mood stabilizers. Antipsychotics help reduce psychotic symptoms, while antidepressants and mood stabilizers help manage mood swings."}, "How does schizoaffective disorder differ from schizophrenia?": {"generation": "Schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness characterized by psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions along with depression and/or mania. It is considered a \"mixed\" diagnosis because it combines elements of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. In general, individuals with schizoaffective disorder experience fewer negative symptoms than those with schizophrenia, but they tend to have more positive symptoms."}, "How does schizoaffective disorder affect daily life?": {"generation": "Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition characterized by psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions along with depression and/or mania. It is estimated that 1 percent of all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia actually have schizoaffective disorder. While some people experience only psychotic episodes, others experience both psychosis and mood swings. Psychotic episodes can last anywhere from days to months, while mood swings can last weeks to years. Someone with schizoaffective disorder may experience periods of normal functioning between episodes."}, "How does medication help manage schizoaffective disorder?": {"generation": "Schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition characterized by psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions along with depression and/or mania. Medication is used to control these symptoms. Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed to reduce psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Mood stabilizers are used to treat mania and depression. Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat depression. In some cases, anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to treat anxiety."}}, "Sinusitis": {"What is sinusitis and how is it caused?": {"generation": "Sinusitis occurs when the cavities around your nasal passages become swollen and inflamed due to a viral or bacterial infection. It is commonly referred to as a \"sinus infection.\" Inflammation of the lining of the nose and sinuses is known as rhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis is classified into two categories: acute and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis lasts less than four weeks and is usually caused by a viral infection. Chronic rhinosinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks and is usually caused by a bacterial infection."}, "What are the common signs or symptoms of sinusitis?": {"generation": "Sinusitis is characterized by nasal obstruction, facial pressure, postnasal drip, thick nasal discharge, decreased sense of smell, headache, fever and fatigue. These symptoms tend to last longer than 10 days and are not due to allergies or a cold. If these symptoms persist despite home remedies such as steam inhalation, decongestants and antihistamines, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. In some cases, steroid sprays may be used to reduce swelling around the nose and sinuses."}, "Can lifestyle changes assist in sinusitis treatment?": {"generation": "Lifestyle changes can help reduce the frequency and severity of sinusitis attacks. These include drinking plenty of fluids, using a humidifier, washing your hands frequently, avoiding smoking and limiting exposure to allergens such as dust mites, pollen and pet dander.

It affects about 50 percent of men between ages 60 and 80. BPH occurs because the cells lining the prostate grow out of control. As these cells multiply, they press on the urethra, causing problems with urination. Urinary frequency, especially at night, is the main symptom of BPH. Other symptoms include difficulty starting urination, weak stream, straining, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling after urination, and hesitancy. In some cases, BPH can lead to acute urinary retention, which means the bladder cannot hold any more urine. If this happens, the person needs immediate medical attention."}, "What are the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia?": {"generation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It affects about 50 percent of men between ages 60 and 80. BPH is not cancer, but it can cause problems such as frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak flow of urine, straining during urination, dribbling at the end of urination, incomplete emptying of the bladder, and hesitancy or delay in beginning urination. These symptoms tend to increase gradually over time. In some cases, BPH can cause urinary retention, which means the bladder cannot hold all the urine produced. Urinary retention can lead to bladder damage, kidney damage, and even death."}, "How is benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosed?": {"generation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is diagnosed based on a physical examination and a digital rectal exam. During the physical exam, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a digital rectal exam to check for any enlargement of the prostate. If BPH is suspected, your doctor may refer you to a urologist for further evaluation. Your urologist will likely conduct a digital rectal exam and possibly a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis."}, "What kinds of treatment are available for benign prostatic hyperplasia?": {"generation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It affects about 50 percent of men between ages 60 and 80. BPH is not considered a cancer, but it can cause problems such as frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak flow of urine, straining during urination, dribbling at the end of urination and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms and the age of the patient. Mild cases may only need lifestyle changes, such as drinking less alcohol and eating fewer high-fat foods. Medications such as alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can help reduce the size of the prostate and improve urinary flow. In some cases, surgery may be necessary."}, "Are there any complications associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia?": {"generation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not cancerous, so it doesn't pose a risk of death. However, BPH can cause problems such as difficulty urinating, frequent urination at night, weak stream, straining, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling after urination, hesitancy, intermittency, frequency, nocturia, retention, suprapubic discomfort, urgency, urinary leakage, and urinary tract infections. These symptoms can affect quality of life and increase the risk of developing chronic kidney disease. In addition, some men develop acute urinary retention, which occurs when the bladder cannot hold urine. If this happens, the man needs immediate medical attention because his bladder could fill up and possibly burst."}, "How does benign prostatic hyperplasia affect daily life?": {"generation": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland.

In addition, some studies suggest that BPH may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer."}}, "Thyroid cancer": {"What are the typical symptoms of thyroid cancer?": {"generation": "Thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for only 1 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year. It occurs when cells in the thyroid grow out of control. Most cases of thyroid cancer are found incidentally during routine physical exams. In fact, about half of all thyroid cancers are discovered when a doctor feels a lump in the neck while performing a routine examination. Other signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, persistent sore throat, earache, voice changes, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight gain, muscle weakness, joint aches and dry skin."}, "How is thyroid cancer diagnosed?": {"generation": "Thyroid cancer is diagnosed using a combination of imaging tests and biopsies. Imaging tests used to detect thyroid cancer include ultrasound, CT scan, MRI and PET scan. These tests help determine the location, size and shape of the tumor. If these tests show suspicious findings, a fine needle aspiration biopsy is done to confirm the presence of cancer cells. During this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the thyroid nodule and cells are removed for examination under a microscope. In some cases, a larger sample of tissue is taken during surgery."}, "What are the common treatments for thyroid cancer?": {"generation": "Thyroid cancer is treated based on the stage of the cancer and the age of the patient. Most cases of thyroid cancer are diagnosed at early stages, so the majority of patients undergo surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. If the entire thyroid gland needs to be removed, hormone replacement therapy is necessary to replace the missing hormones. In some cases, radioactive iodine is used to kill any remaining cancer cells."}, "What is the role of the thyroid in the body?": {"generation": "The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones that regulate metabolism. These hormones control many bodily functions, such as growth and development, energy production and protein synthesis. Thyroid disorders affect approximately 20 million Americans, according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones, while hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces too much hormone. Both conditions can result in weight gain, fatigue, depression, muscle weakness, hair loss and irregular menstrual cycles."}, "What are risk factors for developing thyroid cancer?": {"generation": "Thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for only 1 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year. It occurs more frequently in women than men, and the average age at diagnosis is 40 years old.
