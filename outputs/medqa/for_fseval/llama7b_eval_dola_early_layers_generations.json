It affects approximately 2.3 million Americans, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Seizures are episodes of disturbed brain activity that can cause changes in consciousness, behavior and body movements. These episodes can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Someone having a seizure may lose awareness of his or her surroundings, experience convulsions, stiffen muscles, fall down, or even lose control of bodily functions."}, "How is epilepsy diagnosed?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is diagnosed based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. In some cases, additional tests such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to confirm the diagnosis. An EEG measures electrical activity in the brain and can help determine if seizures are occurring. An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain. These tests can help identify the location of the seizure focus, which is the part of the brain that is causing the seizures."}, "What treatments are available for epilepsy?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It affects approximately 2.3 million Americans, and about 150,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.

Some of the known triggers of seizures include alcohol and drug use, sleep deprivation, stress, fever, flashing lights, certain medications and head injuries."}, "What lifestyle changes may help manage epilepsy?": {"generation": "Lifestyle changes can help reduce seizures and improve quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. These changes include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and managing stress. It is important to note that some medications used to treat epilepsy can interact with alcohol, so it is best to avoid drinking while taking these drugs."}, "How does epilepsy affect daily life?": {"generation": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes seizures. These seizures can range from brief episodes of staring into space to full body convulsions. Some people experience only a few seizures during their lifetime, while others have multiple seizures each day. Seizures can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. In some cases, a person may not remember what happened during the seizure. Seizures can be frightening for both the person experiencing them and those around them. Fortunately, many people with epilepsy live normal lives. With proper treatment, most people with epilepsy can control their seizures and lead productive lives."}}, "Pleural effusion": {"What is pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the lungs and chest wall.

Pleural effusion can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, fever, weight gain, swelling of the legs and feet, and decreased ability to exercise."}, "How is pleural effusion diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion is diagnosed through a physical examination and imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans and ultrasounds. In some cases, a sample of fluid may need to be removed from the chest cavity to confirm the diagnosis."}, "What are the common symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the lungs and chest wall. It can be caused by many things, such as cancer, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, lung diseases, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis and viral infections. Common symptoms of pleural effusion include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain, fatigue, fever, coughing, wheezing and weight gain."}, "What are some potential causes of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion occurs when excess fluid builds up between the lungs and chest wall. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including cancer, heart failure, liver disease, lung disease, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pregnancy and trauma. In many cases, the exact cause cannot be determined. Pleural effusion can be diagnosed with a chest X-ray, CT scan or ultrasound. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is not known, the first step is to drain the fluid. If the fluid returns, additional tests may be necessary to determine the cause."}, "What are the treatments available for pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusions are collections of fluid between the lungs and chest wall. These can be caused by many things, such as cancer, heart failure, liver disease, lung disease, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is not known, a thoracentesis may be done to remove the fluid. In some cases, a drainage tube may be placed in the chest to help drain the fluid. If the fluid is infected, antibiotics may be prescribed. If the fluid is caused by cancer, chemotherapy may be used."}, "How can one manage the symptoms of pleural effusion?": {"generation": "Pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the lungs and chest wall. It can be caused by many things, such as cancer, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, lung diseases, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis and viral infections. The main symptom of pleural effusion is shortness of breath. Other symptoms include chest pain, fatigue, fever, weight gain, wheezing and swelling of the legs. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion. If the cause is not known, the doctor may perform a thoracentesis, which involves inserting a needle into the chest to remove the excess fluid. In some cases, the fluid may be drained using a chest tube."}}, "Pancreatic cancer": {"What are the common symptoms of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. Common symptoms include jaundice, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion, gas, bloating, constipation and diarrhea. Some people experience no symptoms at all until the cancer has progressed significantly."}, "How is pancreatic cancer typically diagnosed?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is typically diagnosed using imaging tests such as CT scans, MRIs and ultrasounds. These tests allow physicians to see the tumor and determine its location and size. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."}, "What treatments are available for pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases. It is important to see your doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes); weight loss; nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; dark stools; light-colored stools; fatty or oily stools; indigestion; gas; bloating; constipation; diarrhea; weakness; dizziness; depression; irritability; loss of appetite; nail changes; numbness or tingling in hands or feet; and yellowish skin or eyes. If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor will perform tests to determine the cause. If pancreatic cancer is found, treatment will depend on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor and the person's overall health."}, "How does the pancreas function in the body?": {"generation": "The pancreas is a large organ located behind the stomach that produces enzymes that help break down food and hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. It also produces insulin, which helps control blood sugar levels. When the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin, it can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can damage nerves and organs throughout the body. Diabetes is the most common cause of pancreatic problems. Other causes include gallstones, alcoholism, pancreatitis and cancer."}, "What are some risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is a rare disease, and its exact cause is unknown. However, certain risk factors increase the likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer. These include smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer, high alcohol intake, diabetes and age."}, "Are there known preventive measures to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer?": {"generation": "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect early because it doesn't produce any noticeable symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage. However, there are some things that can be done to help reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. These include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol consumption."}}}}
