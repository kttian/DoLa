It may also result from medical conditions that produce inflammation.\nThere are 3 types of pleural effusions:\nTransudate: This is a fluid that is produced by injury to the lung or chest wall. This fluid will usually be watery and of lower viscosity. The medical condition that produced this fluid is usually obvious when reviewing the patient\u2019s medical history. The main cause of this fluid is a problem with the heart, including congestive heart failure.\nExudate: This fluid is produced by the body in response to inflammation, infection, or injury. It is usually thicker and may have protein in it. The medical condition that produced this fluid is usually obvious when reviewing the patient\u2019s medical history.", "Many people are diagnosed with a pleural effusion using a chest x-ray. A chest x-ray will reveal a large fluid collection in the space between the lungs and the chest wall (pleural space). The fluid could be either fluid or blood. An x-ray will usually not determine the cause of the fluid, but it will be used to guide additional tests.", "Many people who have pleural effusion do not experience any symptoms. However, if symptoms do occur, the most common ones include chest pain that is often sharp and worsens when breathing, fever, coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue and a dry cough. A person may also experience nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and confusion.", "Many conditions can cause pleural effusion, which is fluid accumulation around the lungs. According to the National Institutes of Health, pleural effusion is often caused by a collapsed lung, pneumonia, heart failure, lung cancer or tuberculosis. In some cases, pleural effusion may occur as a result of a chest injury, surgery, trauma to the chest or infection in the pleural space.", "Many different treatments are available for pleural effusion. The most common treatment for pleural effusion is thoracentesis, which involves the removal of excess fluid that has accumulated around the lungs. This can be performed in a hospital or at a doctor's office. An X-ray or CT scan is often done to determine if the fluid is fluid or blood, and this will determine what treatment is used. Other treatments may include surgery, catheter drainage, or medical therapy, such as antibiotics, steroids, or other medications.", "Many people are diagnosed with a pleural effusion and are often referred to pulmonologists to help manage the symptoms. While there is no cure, the first step in treating the condition is to remove the excess fluid. Doctors often use a needle to drain the fluid from the lung. The fluid will be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed, and the patient may receive blood and/or platelet transfusions if their levels are low. People with pleural effusion often have a cough and shortness of breath. They may also have pain in their chest.", "Many people do not notice the symptoms of pancreatic cancer until the disease has reached an advanced stage, making the disease difficult to diagnose and treat. The symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumor. They include jaundice, which occurs when the liver becomes overloaded with the excessive levels of bilirubin that are produced when the pancreas is not functioning properly. This causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to become yellow. People with jaundice often have itchy skin and dark urine.\nOther symptoms include pain in the abdomen and loss of appetite. People who have diabetes may have their blood sugar levels drop without the use of insulin, which is a common symptom of pancreatic cancer. People with pancreatic cancer may also experience excessive weight loss, nausea and vomiting. As the disease progresses, the patient may develop an", "Pancreatic cancer is diagnosed with a medical history and physical exam, a medical imaging test, a biopsy and possibly additional tests. A medical history and physical examination may reveal symptoms of pancreatic cancer, but usually only after the cancer has grown to a significant size. The patient's medical history will help determine if the person has risk factors for pancreatic cancer.", "Many people receive chemotherapy, radiation or both as their initial treatment for pancreatic cancer. Combination chemotherapy is generally used to treat this disease.\nAlthough many people undergo chemotherapy, some people choose to avoid it. The reasons for avoiding chemotherapy are varied, but they include the potential for side effects, the length of the treatment, and cost.", "The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach. It produces enzymes that help digestion, and hormones that help regulate blood sugar.\nHow is pancreatitis treated?\nThere are many treatment options for pancreatitis, depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In mild cases, treatment may include rest, fluids and pain medication. In more severe cases, treatment may include hospitalization, intravenous fluids, antibiotics and medication to control pain.", "Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. About 42,970 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, and 34,150 will die from the disease. Although many factors can increase the risk for developing pancreatic cancer, most cases of the disease are not caused by any risk factors. Some factors may put someone at risk for developing pancreatic cancer, but the disease is so rare that it is difficult to determine exactly how many people may be affected by these factors. The most common risk factors include age, gender and family history.\nAlthough pancreatic cancer is most common in people over age 65, the disease can affect people of all ages. The average age at diagnosis is 70. It is more common in men than in women, with men being twice as likely as women to develop pancreatic cancer. People with a family history of", "Many risk factors have been associated with pancreatic cancer. As yet, no studies have shown that individuals with these risk factors will actually develop cancer. However, preventive measures to reduce the risk of cancer may be recommended by a physician. Some risk factors for pancreatic cancer include:\nAdvanced age: People older than 65 years of age are at higher risk for pancreatic cancer.\nFamily history: There is an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with a first-degree relative (parent, child, sibling, or sibling's child) with pancreatic cancer.\nObesity: Individuals who are obese are at higher risk for pancreatic cancer.\nDiabetes: Diabetes, especially if it is poorly controlled, is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.\nHigh blood pressure: High blood pressure increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nHigh chol"], "name": ["Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Dysentery", "Dysentery", "Dysentery", "Dysentery", "Dysentery",
