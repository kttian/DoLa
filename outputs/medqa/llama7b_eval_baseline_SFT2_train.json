The test is usually done as part of a routine physical exam.", "The treatment for chronic kidney disease depends on the stage of the disease. In the early stages, the goal is to slow the progression of the disease. This can be done by making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising and quitting smoking. In the later stages, the goal is to manage the symptoms of the disease. This can be done with medications, such as diuretics, which help the body get rid of excess fluid, and blood pressure medications, which help control high blood pressure.", "Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot function normally. This can happen over time, or it can happen suddenly. The most common cause of chronic kidney disease is diabetes. Other causes include high blood pressure, heart disease, polycystic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis and kidney stones.", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot function normally. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluid from the blood. When the kidneys are damaged, they cannot filter the blood properly, and waste and fluid build up in the body. There are five stages of CKD, and each stage has a different set of symptoms. The first stage is called stage 1, and it is characterized by a mild decrease in kidney function. Stage 2 is characterized by a moderate decrease in kidney function, and stage 3 is characterized by a severe decrease in kidney function. Stage 4 is characterized by kidney failure, and stage 5 is characterized by end-stage kidney failure.", "The progression of chronic kidney disease can be slowed down by making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and quitting smoking. People with chronic kidney disease should also get regular checkups with their doctor and follow their doctor's instructions.", "The symptoms of pellagra include diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia and depression. The disease is caused by a deficiency of niacin, or vitamin B3, in the diet. Pellagra is most common in developing countries, where it is often caused by a diet that is low in protein and niacin. In the United States, pellagra is rare, but it can occur in people who have diets that are low in protein and niacin.", "Pellagra is caused by a deficiency of niacin, or vitamin B3. It is a disease that is most common in developing countries, where people do not get enough niacin in their diet. It is also common in people who have diets that are high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat. Pellagra can also be caused by a diet that is high in corn, which is a good source of niacin. However, the niacin in corn is not absorbed well by the body. People who have diets that are high in corn and low in protein and fat are at risk for developing pellagra.", "Pellagra is treated with niacin, which is available in the form of a pill or a liquid. The recommended dose is 500 mg of niacin three times a day. This treatment should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis.", "Pellagra is a disease caused by a deficiency of niacin, or vitamin B3. It is most common in people who eat a diet that is low in protein, niacin and tryptophan. People who eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates and low in protein and niacin are at risk for developing pellagra. People who eat a diet that is high in carbohydrates and low in protein and niacin are at risk for developing pellagra.", "Pellagra is a disease caused by a deficiency of niacin, or vitamin B3. It is characterized by a red, scaly rash on the skin, diarrhea, dementia and, in severe cases, death. The disease is most common in developing countries, where it is caused by a lack of niacin in the diet. It is also possible to develop pellagra in the United States, where it is caused by a lack of niacin in the diet or a lack of the enzyme that converts niacin to its active form.", "If Pellagra is left untreated, it can lead to serious complications. The most common complication is dementia, which can lead to memory loss, confusion and disorientation. It can also lead to diarrhea, dermatitis and death.", "Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that are visible through the skin. They are most commonly found on the legs and feet. Varicose veins are caused by faulty valves in the veins that allow blood to flow backward. This backward flow of blood causes the veins to enlarge and become twisted and bulging. Varicose veins are common in adults, especially women. They are rarely a serious health problem, but they can cause pain, swelling and skin changes.", "Varicose veins are diagnosed by a physical examination. The doctor will look for swollen, twisted, raised veins that are dark blue or purple in color. The doctor will also look for signs of venous insufficiency, such as swelling, skin discoloration, and ulcers. In some cases, the doctor may order an ultrasound to look at the veins in more detail.", "Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins that are usually blue or dark purple in color. They are most commonly found on the legs and feet, but can also appear on the face, ankles and feet. Varicose veins are caused by weak or damaged valves in the veins, which allow blood to flow backward. This causes the veins to swell and become enlarged. Symptoms of varicose veins include swelling, aching, heaviness, itching, burning, throbbing, cramping and restless legs.", "Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that are often blue or red in color. They are most common in the legs and feet, but can also occur in the arms and other parts of the body.

Treatment options for varicose veins include wearing compression stockings, sclerotherapy, laser therapy and surgery.", "The risk factors for developing varicose veins include: family history, pregnancy, obesity, occupations that require standing for long periods of time, and age.", "Varicose veins are caused by weak or damaged vein walls. They can be prevented by avoiding standing or sitting for long periods of time, wearing compression stockings and exercising regularly.", "The most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome are mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, fatigue, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, weight gain and food cravings.
