It can range from being very minor to causing significant damage to the esophagus. In some cases, esophagitis can progress into Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which increases your risk of developing cancer. If you experience frequent episodes of heartburn, talk to your doctor about possible underlying problems such as GERD or hiatal hernias. These conditions need to be addressed so that you don\u2019t develop further complications.", "Esophagitis occurs when the lining of the esophagus becomes irritated due to acid reflux. It is characterized by burning chest pain behind the breastbone, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, sore throat, nausea/vomiting, belching, bloody stools, weight loss and bad breath. If these symptoms persist despite treatment, your doctor might perform tests such as endoscopy, biopsy, upper GI series, CT scan or MRI.", "Esophagitis is generally diagnosed based upon your signs and symptoms along with a physical examination. Your doctor might perform tests such as endoscopy, biopsy, x-rays, CT scan or MRI scans to confirm the presence of esophagitis. Endoscopy allows your physician to view the inside lining of your throat using a thin flexible lighted instrument known as an endoscope. Biopsy helps in identifying any damage done to the cells due to acid reflux. X rays help in determining the location and degree of injury to the esophagus while CT Scan provides detailed information about the structure of the esophagus. An MRI scan uses magnetic fields instead of radiation to produce images of organs within the body.", "Esophagitis occurs when the lining of your esophagus becomes irritated due to acid reflux. Acid reflux happens when stomach acids flow up into the esophagus because the lower esophageal sphincter muscle doesn\u2019t work properly. When this happens frequently, it can damage the cells in the lining of the esophagus causing inflammation known as esophagitis. Other factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, pregnancy, hiatal hernias, certain diseases and allergens can contribute to esophagitis.", "Esophagitis occurs when the lining of the esophagus becomes irritated due to acid reflux. It can range from being very minor to causing significant damage to the esophagus. If your doctor suspects you might have esophagitis, she/he will likely perform tests such as endoscopy, biopsy and upper GI series. These tests help determine what kind of esophagitis you have so that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Common forms of esophagitis include erosive esophagitis, which results in ulcers; Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which affects the cells lining the lower part of the esophagus; and eosinophilic esophagitis, which is characterized by swelling of the esophagus due to allergens.", "Esophagitis occurs when acid reflux reaches the lining of the throat and irritates it. It can be triggered by certain foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit juices, tomatoes, peppermint, garlic, spicy foods, alcohol, coffee, carbonated drinks and fatty meals. Other triggers include smoking, obesity, pregnancy, hiatal hernias, GERD, asthma, allergies, eating disorders and stress. To help reduce your risk of developing esophagitis, try not to eat large meals at nighttime; don\u2019t lie down immediately following a meal; chew slowly and thoroughly; raise the head of your bed 6 inches using bricks underneath the legs of the frame; take frequent breaks while reading or watching TV; wear loose clothes around the waist; lose weight if necessary; quit smoking", "Dysentery is characterized by watery stools containing blood and mucus. It is commonly associated with fevers, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In some cases, individuals experience bloody diarrhea without any accompanying signs or symptoms. Most cases of dysentery resolve within 10 days; however, some cases last longer than four weeks. If your symptoms persist beyond seven days, seek immediate medical attention.", "Dysentery is diagnosed based upon your signs and symptoms along with a physical examination. Your doctor might ask about any recent travel history, especially to developing countries. You may need tests such as stool culture, X-rays, CT scan or ultrasounds to confirm the presence of Shigella bacterial infections.", "Dysentery is characterized by watery stools containing blood and mucus. It is caused by a variety of organisms such as Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia. These microorganisms live in the intestines of humans and animals and produce toxins that damage cells in the large bowel. In addition to causing diarrhea, these toxins can destroy red blood cells, resulting in anemia. Most cases of dysentery resolve without specific therapy within 7 days; however, some individuals develop chronic problems due to scarring of the colon. Antimicrobial agents used to treat dysentery include metronidazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones and ampicillin.", "Dysentery is commonly contracted due to poor sanitation practices such as drinking unsafe water or eating raw vegetables washed in unsanitary water. It is not considered highly infectious because it cannot survive outside the body very long; however, it can still be passed between individuals via stool. In addition, children under 5 years old are at higher risk than adults since their immune systems are less developed.", "Dysentery is a highly infectious intestinal disorder characterized by frequent loose stools containing blood and mucus. It occurs worldwide and affects both children and adults. Risk factors for developing dysentery include poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, lack of access to clean drinking water and eating raw or undercooked meat. Travelers to countries with these risks should take precautions such as washing hands frequently, boiling tap water prior to consumption and not swallowing any water while bathing.", "Dysentery is highly infectious and easily passed between individuals. It is important to practice good hygiene habits such as washing hands frequently throughout the day, especially after using the bathroom; not sharing utensils, cups or plates; and thoroughly cooking meat products prior to eating. If traveling abroad, make sure all drinking water is boiled first. In addition, it is best to eat only freshly prepared meals while away from home.", "Dementia is not a specific diagnosis; rather, it describes a group of symptoms associated with memory problems and cognitive decline. These symptoms can affect daily activities such as driving, managing finances and performing household chores. Common signs of dementia include difficulty remembering recent events, forgetting names of familiar objects, misplacing things frequently, trouble following directions, repeating questions, having poor judgment and becoming easily confused.", "Dementia is not a specific disease; rather, it describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning. Alzheimer\u2019s disease accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of cases of dementia. Other forms of dementia include vascular dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body dementia and mixed dementias. Diagnosis begins with a complete physical examination and review of your medical history. Your doctor might ask about any recent changes in behavior such as personality shifts, agitation, hallucinations or delusions. You may need tests to rule out other possible problems causing these signs and symptoms. These could include thyroid testing, vitamin B12 level, electrolyte levels, lipid profile, glucose tolerance test, hearing evaluation, eye exams, dent", "Dementia is not curable at this time; however, there are many things that can help manage its effects. Medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can slow down some aspects of memory decline. These drugs work best early in the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Other medications used to control behavior problems associated with dementia include antipsychotics, sedatives and sleep aids. Nonpharmacologic interventions include physical activity programs, cognitive stimulation therapy, social activities and music therapies.", "Dementia is not just memory loss; it is a group of signs and symptoms associated with declining mental ability. These changes interfere with normal activities such as driving, working, cooking and managing finances. In addition, individuals with dementia may experience behavior problems, such as agitation, anxiety, delusions, hallucination and wandering. As these behaviors progressively increase, so too does the need for assistance at home.", "Dementia is not just part of aging; however, certain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease increase your chances of developing dementia later in life. Other risk factors associated with dementia include high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, alcoholism and head injuries.", "Dementia is not curable at this time; however, there are many things individuals can do to help manage its effects. These include exercising regularly, eating right, socializing frequently, engaging in activities such as puzzles and games, and maintaining good sleep habits. It is important to keep track of any changes in behavior so that family members and physicians can intervene early enough to make a difference.", "Tonsils are lymph nodes at the back of your throat that help fight off viruses and bacterial infections. When these cells become infected themselves, they swell up and produce white spots on the surface of the tonsil. These white spots are known as exudates. In addition to having reddened tonsils covered with whitish patches, individuals suffering from tonsillitis experience sore throats, fevers, headaches, ear aches, fatigue and difficulty breathing due to enlargement of the adenoids.", "Tonsillectomies are commonly done because of recurrent throat infections. In some cases, however, children might need to undergo a biopsy to rule out cancerous cells. If your child suffers from frequent sore throats, see his doctor about having him tested for strep throat. Strep throat is easily identified using a rapid test kit. Your physician can perform these tests at her office.", "Tonsillectomies are commonly used to remove infected tonsils. Antibiotic therapy is another option; however, some strains of streptococcus resistant to penicillin are becoming increasingly prevalent. In addition, many children experience recurrent episodes of sore throats despite receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapies. Therefore, physicians must consider alternative approaches such as immunotherapeutic agents. These drugs work by stimulating the body\u2019s own defenses rather than killing off invading organisms. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations are given intravenously at high dosages to boost the production of specific antibodies.", "Tonsillectomies are very safe procedures; however, some risks exist. These include bleeding during the procedure, postoperative nausea/vomiting, sore throats, earaches, swollen lymph nodes underneath the jawbone, difficulty breathing due to enlarged adenoids, and possible damage to surrounding structures such as the esophagus, trachea or vocal cord. In rare cases, these problems could result in death.", "Tonsillectomies are commonly done to remove infected tonsils so that they don\u2019t continue to harbor bacterial growth. In addition, vaccines such as the flu shot help protect individuals from viruses that could potentially lead to tonsillitis. It is important to note that while these measures can reduce your risk of developing tonsillitis, some cases cannot always be avoided due to environmental factors.", "Tonsillectomies are very effective at eliminating recurrent sore throats due to chronic tonsillitis. If your child suffers from frequent episodes of acute tonsillitis, talk to his doctor about having him evaluated for possible tonsillectomy. In addition, many children find relief using nonprescription products such as lozenges containing menthol or eucalyptus oil; these help reduce swelling and soothe irritated membranes. Children under age 12 should not take aspirin because of its association with Reye syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disorder affecting the liver and nervous system.", "Cellulitis occurs when bacterial infections enter the deeper layers of the skin. It commonly affects the lower legs, although any part of the body could potentially develop cellulitis. Common signs and symptoms associated with cellulitis include redness, swelling, tenderness, fevers and chills. In some cases, the infectious agent causing cellulitis enters the lymphatic system, resulting in lymphangitis. Lymphangitis presents similar symptoms to those seen with cellulitis; however, it tends to involve only one limb rather than both.", "Cellulitis is generally diagnosed based upon its appearance at physical examination. It appears red and swollen, and sometimes feels hot to the touch. In addition, your doctor might take a sample of the infected site so that cultures can be done to determine what kind of organism is causing the problem. If the culture results come back positive for staph, then further testing such as a CT scan or MRI would likely be ordered to look for signs of abscess formation within the soft tissues.", "Cellulitis is commonly treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy until the infection clears up. In some cases, hospitalization might be necessary so that IV fluids can be administered while the person recovers at home. If the infection becomes very large, a surgeon might need to drain any abscesses formed during the course of the infection.", "Cellulitis occurs when bacterial infections enter the deeper layers of the skin. It commonly affects the lower legs because these parts of the body tend to be warmer than others due to increased circulatory activity. When the temperature increases, so too does the rate at which microbes grow. In addition, the presence of hair follicles makes the skin prone to injury and subsequent infection. Once inside the skin, bacteria multiply rapidly, causing redness, swelling and painful lumps underneath the surface. If not properly diagnosed and treated, cellulitis can progress into septic shock, which is fatal without immediate intervention.", "Cellulitis occurs when bacterial infections enter the body through breaks in the skin such as cuts, scrapes or insect bites. It commonly affects the lower legs because these parts of the body tend to break down easily due to friction and pressure. Other risk factors for cellulitis include having poor circulation, being obese, smoking, alcoholism, diabetes, immune system disorders and certain chronic diseases.", "Cellulitis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that affects the deep layers of the skin and underlying soft tissues. It occurs when bacteria enter the body through breaks in the skin such as cuts, scrapes, burns or insect bites. Luckily, many cases of cellulitis can be avoided altogether simply by practicing good hygiene habits. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day, especially after using the bathroom; keep all cuts cleaned and covered until fully healed; wear shoes outside instead of going barefoot; and don\u2019t share razors or towels. If you notice any signs of cellulitis \u2014 redness, swelling, tenderness, fevers above 102 degrees Fahrenheit, chills, fatigue, muscle aches or headaches \u2014 see your doctor right away so that proper diagnosis and treatment can take place.", "Inflammatory diseases affecting the walls of blood vessels are known collectively as vasculitides. These disorders can involve any part of the body, although some forms primarily affect specific organs such as the lungs, eyes or joints. Some forms of vasculitis produce no signs at all until the damage becomes so advanced that organ function is impaired. Other forms of vasculitis produce characteristic rashes, fevers, fatigue and weight loss. Many forms of vasculitis respond quickly to corticosteroid therapy; however, others progress despite aggressive treatment.", "Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and review of your medical history. Your doctor might ask about any recent injuries or surgeries, family history of vasculitides, exposures such as chemicals at work or hobbies, and current medicines being taken. You may need tests to help confirm the diagnosis. These could include imaging studies such as X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans or MRIs; lab testing such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein level, lipid profile, thyroid function test, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN/creatinine ratio, glucose levels, cholesterol screenings, HIV serology, rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody panel, complement levels, angiogram, echocardiography, pulmonary function study, lung biopsy,", "Treatment depends upon what kind of vasculitis the person has. Inflammatory forms such as giant cell arteritis need immediate attention because without prompt diagnosis and treatment, blindness could result within 24 hours. Other forms of vasculitis respond better to steroid therapy than others. Steroids reduce swelling around the vessel wall and decrease inflammation. If the doctor thinks your vasculitis might be due to another problem, tests may be done to look at possible underlying diseases. These would include rheumatoid factor testing, CBC, cholesterol levels, thyroid function test, lipid profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP level, antiphospholipid antibody screening, HIV serology, Lyme titers, syphilis serologies, and possibly biopsy of any lesions found during examination.", "Inflammatory diseases affecting the walls of blood vessels are known collectively as vasculitides. These disorders involve swelling of the vessel wall due to immune system dysfunction. Causative factors include viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus; drugs used to suppress the body\u2019s immunity following organ transplantation; certain autoimmune diseases; and environmental exposures such as silica dust. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, hypertension, and family history.", "Complications associated with vasculitis range widely based upon what part of your body is involved. If the lungs are involved, respiratory distress could result due to pulmonary embolism or pleural effusion. Involvement of the central nervous system could result in seizures, coma or death. Inflammatory bowel disease could develop secondary to involvement of the intestines. Heart problems such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias or valvular insufficiency could arise. Skin lesions could appear anywhere on the body and could ulcerate. Joint swelling and stiffness could affect any joint in the body.", "Lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, eating a balanced diet rich in vegetables and fruit, exercising regularly, maintaining a normal weight and limiting alcohol consumption can all play important roles in managing vasculitis. In addition, stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga and deep breathing exercises can reduce anxiety levels and improve overall quality of life.", "Liver cancer occurs when cells within the liver grow out of control and form tumors. These tumors can interfere with normal functioning of the organ, causing problems such as jaundice, weight loss, fatigue and nausea. In some cases, these tumors can metastasize throughout the body, affecting organs such as the lungs, stomach, intestines and pancreas. If caught early enough, liver cancer can sometimes be successfully treated using minimally invasive procedures such as radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy and microwave coil therapies.", "Liver cancer is difficult to detect because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with many less serious diseases such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and jaundice. In addition, some cases of cirrhosis go undiagnosed until later stages of the disease. Therefore, screenings are not routinely done for individuals without risk factors. If any of these symptoms persist, however, your doctor might perform tests to determine what is causing them. These could include imaging studies such as ultrasounds, CT scans or MRIs; biopsies; and blood work.", "Liver cancer is diagnosed based upon imaging tests such as CT scans, MRI scans and ultrasounds. Once confirmed, the next step is determining what stage the tumors are at. Staging helps determine prognosis and appropriate therapy. If the cancer is localized within the liver itself, surgery is considered curative. In cases where the cancer has metastasized outside the liver, chemotherapy and radiation are used to control the growth of the primary tumor while slowing down any secondary sites of involvement.", "Liver cancer can negatively impact your general health because it prevents proper functioning of the body. It can interfere with normal metabolism processes such as protein synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and glucose production. In addition, it can disrupt hormone regulation and immune system functions. If not diagnosed early enough, liver cancer can result in death within months due to internal bleeding, organ damage and/or sepsis.", "Risk factors for liver cancer include cirrhosis due to alcoholism; chronic viral hepatitis B or C; obesity; fatty liver disease; iron deficiency anemia; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; metabolic syndrome; and exposure to certain chemicals such as vinyl chloride, carbon tetrafluoroethane, polychlorinated biphenyls and thorotrast. Other risk factors include having had gallbladder problems, being male, smoking, eating a high-fat diet, drinking too much alcohol, having HIV/AIDS, having inherited diseases such as alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, Wilson\u2019s disease and hemochromatosis, and having been exposed to radiation therapy at a young age.", "Lifestyle choices such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking and limiting alcohol consumption can all play a role in helping to reduce your risk of developing liver cancer. In addition, individuals at high risk for liver cancer due to chronic viruses such as HCV or HBV should consider being tested annually for these diseases. If diagnosed early enough, both HCV and HBV can be successfully managed with appropriate therapy.", "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in your lungs swell up due to irritants such as dust, smoke or pollen. It is characterized by a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness. In some cases, fevers and fatigue may accompany these symptoms. If you experience any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away so that proper diagnosis and treatment can take place.", "Bronchitis is generally diagnosed based upon your signs and symptoms along with a physical examination. Your doctor might take samples of sputum (mucus) from deep inside your lungs using a special instrument known as a fiberoptic scope. In some cases, X-rays or CT scans might help determine what\u2019s causing your symptoms.", "Bronchitis is generally diagnosed based upon signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, chills, fevers and fatigue. If your doctor suspects you might have bronchitis, she/he will likely perform tests to rule out any underlying diseases. These tests could include X-rays, CT scans, pulmonary function testing and sputum cultures. Once these results come back negative, your physician will probably prescribe some sort of anti-inflammatory medicine along with a decongestant. In addition, you may need to take antiviral drugs if you contracted viral bronchiolitis.", "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in your lungs swell up due to irritants such as dust, smoke, chemical vapors, pollen, viruses and bacterial infections. It is characterized by excess production of phlegm, shortness of breath, wheezing and chest tightness. Acute bronchitis lasts less than 10 days while chronic bronchitis lasts longer than 3 months. Chronic bronchitis is generally associated with smoking.", "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in your lungs swell up due to irritants such as smoke, dust, pollen, chemicals or viruses. It is important to note that smoking increases your chances of having chronic bronchitis because it makes the airway even narrower than normal. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, being around others who smoke, living in polluted environments, working at jobs involving heavy amounts of dust, and having allergies or asthma.", "Bronchitis is characterized by irritability of the airways due to excess production of mucus. It is important to keep your body hydrated during times of increased respiratory secretions because dehydration makes breathing difficult. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin out the mucous so it becomes easier to clear up. In addition, drinking hot liquids such as tea or soup can loosen phlegm and make it easier to expel. If you smoke, quitting smoking is essential to managing chronic bronchitis. Smokers tend to experience frequent exacerbations of acute bronchitis compared to non-smokers.", "Goiter is characterized by enlargement of the thyroid gland due to excess production of thyroid hormones. It is not always possible to determine what is causing the increased secretion of these hormones; however, some cases are associated with iodine deficiency. Other factors such as pregnancy, certain drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Graves\u2019 disease, Hashimoto\u2019s disease, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and radiation therapy to the neck region can all contribute to goiters. In addition, goitres can develop because of benign tumors known as adenomas. These tumours produce too much thyroid hormone, resulting in the swelling seen in goitres.", "Goiter is generally detected during routine physical examination. If your doctor suspects a thyroid problem based upon your history, signs and symptoms, further tests such as ultrasounds, radioactive iodine scans and biopsies might be ordered. These tests help determine what kind of goiter you have and its underlying cause.", "Goiter is generally not considered harmful; however, some cases can progress into thyroid cancer. If your doctor suspects cancer, she/he might perform a biopsy to determine what kind of cells make up the tumour. In addition, your physician may want to check your levels of TSH, free T4 and free T3 hormones. These tests help her/him decide if you need additional testing such as ultrasounds, CT scans or radioactive iodine therapy. Your doctor may prescribe anti-thyroid drugs to shrink the enlarged thyroid gland.", "Goiter occurs when the thyroid gland becomes enlarged due to excess production of hormones. It is not clear what exactly triggers this increase in hormone production; however, some factors associated with increased risk of developing a goitre include iodine deficiency, pregnancy, certain autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In addition, individuals with family members who had a goitre at any point during childhood are likely to develop one themselves.", "Goiter is defined as enlargement of the thyroid gland due to excess production of hormones. It occurs because of increased demand for iodide ions within the cells of the thyroid gland. Increased intake of iodides increases the rate at which these ions enter into the cellular metabolism. If the supply of iodines exceeds the requirement, the extra amount accumulates outside the cells causing swelling of the thyroid gland. Risk Factors for Developing Goitres: \u2022\tIodine deficiency - Iodine deficient countries such as India, China etc., have high prevalence rates of goiters. \u2022\tCongenital defects \u2013 Congenital hypothyroidism results in decreased activity of the thyroid glands resulting in underproduction of thyroid hormone. \u2022\tPregnancy \u2013 Pregnant women need higher amounts of", "Goiter is generally not harmful; however, some cases can result in difficulty breathing due to compression of the windpipe. In these situations, surgery might be necessary. Luckily, many cases of goiter respond very well to simple changes in your daily routine. These include eating smaller meals throughout the day instead of large ones at nighttime, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight. If you smoke, quitting smoking can reduce swelling around the thyroid gland.", "Cardiomyopathy means \"heart muscle disease.\" It occurs when the heart muscles weaken and cannot contract normally. When this happens, the heart becomes less able to circulate oxygen throughout the body. In some cases, the heart muscles thicken instead of becoming weaker. Either way, the result is poor function of the heart. Heart failure is the term used to describe what happens when the heart fails to adequately supply enough blood flow to meet the needs of the rest of the body.", "Cardiomyopathy occurs when the muscle walls of your heart weaken and cannot contract properly. It can affect both sides of the heart equally or just one side at a time. In some cases, only part of the wall becomes thicker while another section remains normal. Some forms of cardiomyopathy run in families; others develop without any known reason. Types of cardiomyopathy include dilated, hypertrophic obstructive, restrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardio myopathy syndrome. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by enlargement of the lower chambers of the heart due to decreased contraction force. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy results from thickened heart muscles that interfere with the flow of oxygen-rich blood out of the heart. Restrictive cardiomy", "Cardiomyopathy occurs when the muscles of your heart weaken and fail to function properly. It can affect both sides of the heart equally or just one side at a time. In some cases, only certain parts of the heart are involved while others appear normal. Some forms of cardiomyopathy run in families; however, many times no family history exists. Common signs and symptoms associated with cardiomyopathy include shortness of breath during physical activity, fatigue, swelling of feet/ankles/legs, chest discomfort, palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, irregular heartbeats, weight gain due to excess fluid retention, difficulty sleeping, and rapid heart rate.", "Cardiomyopathy is diagnosed based upon your signs and symptoms along with tests such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. Your doctor might also perform stress testing, chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI, angiograms and biopsy. In some cases, your doctor might suggest genetic testing.", "Cardiomyopathy cannot currently be reversed; however, some cases can be controlled with lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating right and exercising regularly. Medicines used to control high blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help reduce strain on your heart muscle. In addition, implantable defibrillators and pacemakers can regulate irregular heartbeats. If these measures fail, a doctor might suggest a heart transplant.", "Lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and maintaining a normal weight can help reduce your risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. In addition, individuals diagnosed with cardiomyopathy need to see their doctor frequently so that any signs of deterioration can be caught early enough to make necessary adjustments.", "Pain is the primary symptom associated with osteoarthritis. It tends to develop gradually and affects joints throughout the body. Joint stiffness is another sign of osteoarthritis; however, some individuals experience no discomfort at all. In addition, swelling around the joints is not always seen, although it occurs frequently enough to warrant mention here. Other signs of osteoarthritis include decreased range of motion, grinding sensations during movement, creaking sounds while moving, and deformities such as bowed legs or curved fingers.", "Diagnosis begins with a physical examination during which your doctor checks joint movement and muscle strength. Your doctor might ask about any recent injuries or accidents, family history of arthritis, previous surgeries and current activities such as sports participation. X-rays provide images of cartilage and underlying bone structure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed pictures of soft tissues within the body without radiation exposure. Ultrasounds show internal structures using sound waves rather than x-rays. Joint aspiration uses needles inserted into the joint space to remove samples of synovial fluid for analysis under a microscope.", "There are many nonoperative treatments available for individuals suffering from osteoarthritis. These range from physical therapy to weight management programs. In some cases, steroid injections into joint spaces can help reduce swelling and provide temporary relief. If these measures fail, total knee replacement or hip resurfacing procedures might be considered.", "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder characterized by progressive wearing away of cartilage within the joint. It commonly occurs in weight bearing joints such as knee, hip, spinal facets and hands. As the cartilage breaks down, the underlying bone becomes exposed causing painful rubbing between the bones. In addition, the surrounding soft tissues become swollen and stiff resulting in decreased range of motion. These changes result in significant functional limitations and impair quality of life.", "Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis include age, obesity, joint injury/trauma, family history, gender and certain occupational hazards. Age is probably the biggest factor associated with development of osteoarthritis because cartilage becomes less elastic and flexible as we grow older. Obese individuals put extra stress on weight bearing joints such as knee and hip, increasing the likelihood of developing osteoarthritis. Joint injuries increase the chance of developing osteoarthritis later in life due to damage done to the articular cartilage during traumatic events. Family members with osteoarthritis increases your chances of having the same problem. Women tend to develop osteoarthritis at younger ages than men. Occupations involving repetitive motion, heavy lifting and prolonged standing can all contribute to increased wear and tear on joints, resulting in early on", "Coping with any chronic condition takes time and effort; however, many individuals find relief using various techniques such as physical therapy, weight management programs, occupational therapists, support groups and alternative medicine practices. Physicians generally prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids and/or opioids to manage pain associated with osteoarthritis. In addition, physiotherapeutic modalities such as ultrasounds, electrical stimulation and heat packs help reduce joint stiffness and improve range of motion.", "Children with autistic spectrum disorders exhibit behaviors such as repetitive movements, unusual responses to sensory stimuli, difficulty communicating verbally and nonverbally, and social withdrawal. These children tend not to respond normally to others around them; however, some individuals with ASD show normal development until 18 months old, at which point they regress into these behaviors. Some children develop language skills later than expected while others never speak. Many children with ASD display obsessive interests related to certain topics, objects or activities.", "Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination and review of your child\u2019s developmental history. Your doctor might ask questions about your family\u2019s medical history and any concerns you have regarding your child\u2019s behavior. You may want to keep track of certain behaviors at home so you can share these observations during appointments. If autistic traits are suspected, additional testing such as neuroimaging tests, electroencephalogram (EEG) and spinal tap (lumbar puncture) may help confirm the diagnosis.", "While no single treatment works best for all children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, many families find some combination of behavior therapy, speech/language therapists, occupational therapy and special education services helpful. Medicines such as antipsychotics, stimulants and antidepressant drugs might help control certain behaviors associated with ASD. Some parents report success using alternative approaches such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vitamins and minerals, chelators, gluten free/casein free diets, secretin, stem cell transplants and others.", "Yes, autistic children can develop normally until about 18 months old, and then start losing skills such as speech development and social interaction. It is not known what exactly triggers these changes, although some researchers believe that environmental factors play a role. In addition, many parents report that their child was developing normally up until around 12 months old, and then started showing signs of autism.", "Researchers believe autism occurs due to both environmental and genetic influences. While no single factor appears responsible for causing ASD, certain things increase your child\u2019s chance of having developmental delays. These include: \u2022\tHaving older parents \u2022\tBeing born prematurely \u2022\tA family history of mental retardation or seizures \u2022\tExposure to high levels of chemicals such as mercury while still in the mother\u2019s womb \u2022\tLow birth weight \u2022\tInfections during pregnancy \u2022\tVaccination schedule \u2022\tMaternal age under 20 years old \u2022\tMother smoking during pregnancy \u2022\tFather drinking alcohol during pregnancy \u2022\tFamily history of schizophrenia \u2022\tCertain metabolic problems \u2022\tPregnancy complication \u2022\tPrevious miscarriage/prematurity \u2022\tMultiple gestational pregnancies", "Social skill training programs help individuals learn appropriate behaviors so they can interact successfully within society. These programs teach participants about eye contact, body language, facial expressions, gestures, conversation topics and conversational turn-taking. Programs such as these focus on teaching specific skills rather than general concepts. In addition, parents play an important role in helping their child practice new skills at home between sessions.", "Acne occurs due to excess oil production combined with dead cells blocking pores. Hormones play a role because teenagers experience increased hormone levels during puberty, causing sebum production to increase. Other factors such as stress, poor nutrition, certain cosmetics and environmental pollutants can contribute to acne development.", "Acne is a very common problem among teenagers and young adults. It occurs due to excess oil production combined with dead cells blocking pores. In addition, hormonal changes during puberty contribute to increased sebum secretion. Although many factors play into its development, some individuals experience breakouts even though they don\u2019t produce much oil at all. Fortunately, there are effective treatments available today. These range from topical creams containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to prescription drugs such as Accutane.", "Acne vulgaris is the most common type of acne seen in adolescents and adults. It occurs due to excess sebum production combined with dead cells blocking hair follicles. Blackheads develop because the oil becomes oxidized at the surface of the skin; whiteheads result when the pores fill up with keratin debris instead of air. Pimples appear when these blackheads and whiteheads become infected with Propionibacterium acnes, causing redness, swelling and tenderness around the lesions. Inflammatory papules and nodular acne are less common forms of acne. These involve deeper infections within the dermis layer of the skin.", "Acne occurs due to excess oil production combined with dead cells blocking pores. Dietary factors such as dairy products, chocolate, nuts, peanut butter, soybeans, wheat germ, whole grains, eggs, fish oils, shellfish, red meat, refined sugars and processed meats all contribute to increased sebum secretion. Increased intake of vitamins C and B6, zinc, folic acid and omega 3 fatty acids help reduce acne breakouts.", "Hygienic practices such as washing your face twice daily with soap and water, using noncomedogenic products and not picking at lesions all help reduce breakouts. It\u2019s important to keep hair away from the face because oil secretion from the scalp can contribute to acne. Also, makeup should never come into direct contact with active acne; instead, apply cosmetics first onto clean hands and then pat them lightly across the face.", "Acne is not only unsightly; it can also leave scars behind once it clears up. These scars can range from minor white marks to deep depressions in the skin. In some cases, these scars can even affect your ability to work due to embarrassment about having visible facial disfigurements. Fortunately, many methods exist today to help minimize the appearance of acne scarring. One method used to reduce the appearance of acne scars is laser resurfacing. Lasers remove layers of scarred skin at a time until the surface layer of the skin is smooth again. Another option is dermabrasion, during which the topmost layers of skin are removed using a rotary instrument. Dermabrasion leaves the face reddened and swollen immediately following the procedure, but results last longer than those achieved with laser therapy.", "Primary symptomatic signs of sickle cell disease include episodes of acute chest syndrome, chronic lung problems such as pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, priapism, eye damage, delayed growth and development, and frequent hospitalizations due to repeated vaso-occlusions. These events can result in significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, individuals with sickle cell disease experience increased rates of infectious diseases compared to those without the disorder.", "Diagnosis begins with a complete physical examination and review of your family history. Your doctor might ask about any signs or symptoms you\u2019ve had recently such as fevers, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, vision problems or jaundice. You may need additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. These could include a CBC test, which measures red blood cells; a reticulocyte count, which looks at immature red blood cells; a hemoglobin electrophoresis, which checks levels of hemoglobin; and a DNA analysis, which determines the specific mutation causing the disorder.", "Potential treatments for sickle cell disease include transfusions, hydroxycarbamide therapy, penicillin G procaine therapy, corticosteroids, oxygen therapy, chelators such as deferoxamine, iron chelator drugs, folic acid, vitamin B12, erythropoietins, immunoglobulin infusion, splenectomies, stem cells, gene therapies and others. These treatments help reduce the frequency of crises, improve quality of life and increase survival rates.", "Patients with sickle cell disease experience episodes known as crises during which time they feel very tired and short of breath due to vaso-occlusion, or obstruction of blood flow within the body. These episodes last anywhere between 10 minutes and seven days. During these times, individuals need extra oxygen and fluids because their bodies cannot deliver enough oxygen to meet their needs. In addition, many patients develop chronic lung problems such as pulmonary hypertension and asthma. Other long-term effects of sickle cell disease include damage to joints, eye problems, gallbladder disease, liver disease and stroke.", "Inherited diseases such as sickle cell disease are passed down from parents to children via DNA. If both parents carry the gene mutation responsible for causing sickle cell disease, each child born to those parents has a 25 percent chance of having inherited the defective gene. When only one parent passes along the faulty gene, the child still has a 1 in 4 chance of developing sickle cell disease.", "Managing the symptoms of sickle cell disease depends largely upon what stage of the disease the person is experiencing at any given time. In general, however, individuals suffering from this disorder need plenty of rest, fluids and nutrients. Medicines such as aspirin and ibuprofen help reduce fevers associated with the disease. Pain management techniques such as acupressure, massages and meditation can provide relief during episodes of intense pain.", "Common signs and symptoms associated with ovarian cancer include bloating, pelvic pressure/fullness, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, frequent need to urinate, constipation, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, backache, menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, changes in bowel habits, weight gain or loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, dizziness, numbness or tingling sensations, swelling of hands or feet, hair loss, dry mouth, sores inside the nose or throat, hoarseness, change in voice pitch, lumps under the arms or around the neck, breast tenderness, nipple discharge, unusual bleeding such as between periods, heavy periods, postmenopausal bleeding, etc., and others.", "Most cases of ovarian cancer are not detected until later stages because early signs and symptoms are vague and nonspecific. In fact, many women don\u2019t experience any symptoms at all. When symptoms appear, they tend to resemble those associated with less serious problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, menopause, premenstrual syndrome, constipation, gas, bloating, indigestion, fatigue, pelvic discomfort, frequent urination, vaginal dryness, etc., so these symptoms aren\u2019t taken seriously enough. If your doctor suspects ovarian cancer based upon your history and physical exam, she/he might suggest further testing using ultrasounds, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans, biopsies, CA 125 levels, etc.", "If diagnosed early enough, many women with ovarian cancer can undergo successful treatment without having to lose their reproductive organs. In some cases, chemotherapy alone can shrink tumors large enough so that surgeons can remove only part of the ovary instead of all of it. Women whose ovaries cannot be saved because of advanced stage disease still benefit greatly from hormone therapies such as estrogens and progesterones. These drugs help reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival rates.", "Ovarian cancer occurs when cells within the ovary grow out of control and form tumors. These tumors can interfere with normal functioning of the organ and surrounding structures. In addition, these tumors can metastasize \u2014 meaning they break away from the original site and travel throughout the rest of the body via the lymphatic system or bloodstream. When this happens, the cancerous cells can settle into various organs such as the liver, lung, stomach, intestines and even the brain.", "Risk factors associated with developing ovarian cancer include age, family history, obesity, infertility, hormone replacement therapy, smoking and certain reproductive characteristics such as never having children or giving birth at an older age. Women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or 2 gene are also at increased risk.", "Preventative measures for ovarian cancer include having children early in life; undergoing fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy or radiation therapy; using birth control pills; and limiting exposures to certain chemicals such as talcum powders, herbal remedies containing phytoestrogen, and estrogens found in hormone replacement therapies.", "Influenza is characterized by fevers, chills, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue and sore throats. These symptoms tend to come on suddenly within 24 hours of exposure to the flu virus. Some individuals experience vomiting and/or diarrhea along with these symptoms. Children under age five and adults older than 65 years old are at higher risk for developing complications such as bronchitis, sinus problems and ear infections due to the flu.", "Influenza viruses are spread mainly person-to-person via droplets made when infected persons sneeze, cough or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby individuals. Less commonly, these flu viruses might be spread when people touch something that has been contaminated with germs and then touch their own mouths or eyes. It takes only about 1 day for the influenza virus to replicate itself once inside your body. Most experts believe that direct exposure to another person\u2019s respiratory secretions is necessary for transmission of the virus.", "Influenza is commonly treated with rest, fluids and fever reducers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antiviral drugs are available to help shorten the duration of the illness; however, these must be started within 48 hours of becoming infected. If your doctor prescribes antivirals, make sure to take all dosages exactly as directed. It takes about five days for the medicine to work its magic.", "Influenza viruses change every year, so each season new flu shots must be developed. These changes make it difficult to predict what strains of the virus will circulate during any given flu season. That\u2019s why experts develop multiple versions of the flu shot \u2014 some targeted at specific age groups while others protect against all four main strains of the virus.", "Influenza is considered a seasonal respiratory illness that affects millions of Americans each year. It is estimated that 5% to 20% of the U.S. population gets infected annually. While anyone can contract flu, certain groups are particularly vulnerable due to age, underlying diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and immune system deficiencies. These individuals need to take extra precautions during flu season because they are less able to fight off viruses than others.", "Influenza viruses are highly infectious and easily passed between individuals via droplets released into the air during sneezing or coughing. These drops contain live flu viruses and can survive up to 24 hours outside the body. To help stop the spread of these viruses, wash your hands frequently throughout the day using soap and water; cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; disinfect commonly touched objects such as door knobs, light switches and telephones; and keep children home from school until fevers subside. If you suspect you might have contracted the flu, see your doctor immediately so you don\u2019t pass along the virus to others.", "Prostate problems affect men differently; however, some of the most common signs and symptoms associated with prostatic disorders include frequent need to urinate at night, difficulty starting urination, burning sensation during urination, weak stream while urinating, dribbling following urination, lower back pressure, pelvic pain, testicular swelling, fevers, chills, sweats, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, weight gain, decreased libido, erection difficulties, ejaculation difficulties, infertility, impotence, etc.", "Prostate problems such as benign enlargement of the prostate, chronic pelvic pain syndrome and acute bacterial prostatitis are all diagnosed using a combination of physical examination findings and tests. In addition to a complete history and physical examination, your doctor might perform some of these additional tests: Digital rectal exam - Your doctor inserts his finger into your rectum to feel the shape and texture of your prostate. If necessary, your doctor may take samples of cells from your prostate during this procedure. Urinalysis - You provide a sample of your urine so that your doctor can check for signs of infection. Cystometry test - During this test, your doctor places a thin tube inside your penis while you lie flat on your back. He measures pressure changes within your bladder as you empty your bladder. Ultrasound scan - An ultrasonographer uses sound waves to create images of structures", "Prostate problems such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) affect millions of men each year.

In some cases, however, BPH becomes so enlarged that it blocks the flow of urine out of the body. If this occurs, it could result in permanent damage to the kidneys and even death.", "Prostate problems affect men at all ages; however, older men tend to experience these disorders more frequently than younger ones. In fact, 50 percent of men between the ages of 40 and 79 years old report having some sort of prostatic problem. Men aged 80 and above account for about half of those diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and almost 60 percent of cases involving chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS).", "Prostate problems such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis affect millions of men each year. While BPH occurs naturally as part of aging, prostatitis is not considered normal and can result from injury, infections or certain diseases. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and sexual activity can increase your risk of developing these disorders. Men who smoke tend to develop BPH earlier than those who don\u2019t smoke; however, quitting smoking can help reduce the chance of developing BPH later in life. Alcohol intake increases the risk of both BPH and prostatitis because it irritates the prostate and reduces its ability to empty properly. Sexual intercourse can put pressure on the prostate and contribute to prostatitis.", "Mumps is characterized by swelling around the cheeks and jawline due to enlarged salivary glands. Other signs and symptoms associated with mumps include fevers, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. In some cases, individuals experience hearing problems such as ringing ears or temporary deafness. It takes about 16 days for symptoms to appear following exposure to the virus. Most children recover within seven to ten days without any lasting effects; however, adults tend to develop chronic ear infections and meningitis.", "Mumps is highly infectious and is passed between individuals via saliva droplets released into the air during sneezing or coughing. It takes about 12 days for symptoms to appear following exposure to the virus. Infected persons shed the virus in their saliva up until five days prior to developing swelling around the jawline. Once exposed, children under age 6 are at greatest risk of contracting the disease because their immune systems aren\u2019t fully developed yet. Adults tend not to develop any symptoms, although some experience flu-like symptoms such as fevers, headaches and muscle aches.", "Mumps is generally not considered very serious because it rarely results in death; however, it can result in permanent hearing loss in 10 percent of cases. In addition, some individuals develop meningoencephalitis, which is swelling around the brain and spinal cord. Other possible complications include pancreatic problems such as acute pancreatitis, ovarian dysfunction, testicular atrophy and sterility.", "Mumps is highly infectious and easily passed between individuals via saliva droplets released into the air during sneezing or coughing. It cannot survive long outside the body; however, once inside the human host, it takes about 12 days to develop. Once contracted, the best way to protect others is to limit exposure to those already infected. Vaccination is another option. Two doses of vaccines administered at least four weeks apart provide protection against mumps.", "Mumps is generally not considered a very serious illness; however, some individuals experience long-term problems such as hearing loss, menstrual disorders and sterility. Most cases resolve without any specific treatment within 10 days. If the person experiences swelling around the salivary glands, antihistamines can help reduce the swelling. Pain relief medicine can also ease the pain associated with mumps. In rare instances, hospitalization might be necessary due to dehydration or high fevers.", "Mumps is generally diagnosed based upon clinical presentation; however, some cases may need further testing such as imaging studies or lab tests.

These individuals experience hallucination, delusions, thought disturbances and behavior changes during the psychosis phase. During nonpsychotic phases, however, they exhibit no signs of mental illness. In addition, some individuals diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder display similar behaviors without meeting all criteria necessary for a formal diagnosis.", "Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination and review of your medical history. Your doctor will ask about any family members who might have had similar problems. You may need tests such as blood work, X-rays, CT scans or MRIs to rule out other possible diseases. If no other problem is found, psychiatric evaluation will help determine if you meet criteria for schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder.", "Schizophreniform disorders involve psychotic episodes lasting less than six months. These individuals experience hallucination, delusions and/or thought disorganization. In addition, these individuals exhibit depression, anxiety and social withdrawal. Medicines such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers help control the symptoms associated with schizoaffective disorder. Antipsychotics work best at reducing positive symptoms while antidepressant drugs reduce negative symptoms. Mood stabilizing agents help regulate emotional responses.", "Schizoaffective disorder is similar to schizophrenia because both involve psychotic episodes characterized by hallucination and delusions. But unlike schizophrenia, individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder experience depression along with these psychotic episodes. In addition, while some cases of schizophrenia resolve without any long term effects, those suffering from schizoaffective disorders tend to develop chronic mental problems such as anxiety and depressive disorders.", "Schizophreniform disorders involve psychotic episodes similar to those seen in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. These episodes last at least six months and are accompanied by depression, anxiety or mania. In addition, these individuals experience hallucination, delusions and thought disturbances. While some individuals only experience psychosis during periods of stress, others experience psychiatric problems throughout their lives. Someone suffering from schizoaffective disorder may not recognize reality and may believe things such as hearing voices telling him what to do. He might think his thoughts are being broadcasted out loud so everyone else knows about them.", "Schizophreniform disorders involve psychotic episodes similar to those seen in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. These episodes last at least six months and are accompanied by depression, anxiety or mania.

Antipsychotics are generally effective in reducing both positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophreniaspectrum disorders.", "Sinuses are air spaces within the skull around your nose. When these passages become swollen due to allergens such as pollen, dust mites or pet dander; viruses, bacterial infections or fungi, it results in sinusitis. Inflamed nasal membranes lining the sinuses produce excess amounts of mucous, causing pressure inside the head. If not properly drained, the trapped mucous becomes infected and causes further irritation. Common signs and symptoms associated with acute sinusitis include facial tenderness, fevers, fatigue, postnasal discharge, bad breath, decreased sense of smell/taste, ear fullness, eye redness, greenish yellow nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, toothaches and upper jaw pain.

Chronic sinusitis may need additional treatment, such as allergy shots, steroids, antifungals or antibiotics.", "Pernicious anemia occurs due to insufficient production of intrinsic factor, which helps absorb vitamin B12 into cells throughout the body. As a result, individuals develop megaloblastic anemia, characterized by large red blood cell precursors known as megalocytes. Other signs and symptoms associated with pernicious anemia include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, pale skin color, numbness/tingling sensations in hands and feet, difficulty walking, depression, confusion, memory problems, irritability, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bloody stools, weight loss, poor appetite, sore tongue, mouth ulcers, dry eyes, dry mouth, brittle hair and nails, muscle cramps, joint aches and swollen legs.", "Pernicious anemia occurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce enough red blood cells because of vitamin B12 deficiency. Your doctor might suspect pernicious anemia based on your signs and symptoms alone; however, additional tests such as complete blood count, serum iron level test, folate levels and vitamin B12 levels help confirm the diagnosis. If these results show evidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, further testing using radioactive iodine scans helps determine whether damage to the stomach lining is causing malabsorption of nutrients.", "Pernicious anemia occurs due to insufficient production of intrinsic factor, which helps absorb vitamin B12 into cells throughout the body. Vitamin B12 deficiency can result in fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, pale skin color, numbness/tingling sensations, memory problems, depression, confusion and difficulty walking. In addition, nerve damage can develop, resulting in permanent neurological disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, ataxia and myelopathy. If not properly diagnosed and treated early enough, these effects could progressively worsen until death results.", "Pernicious anemia occurs when your immune system attacks cells in your stomach lining that produce intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for absorbing vitamin B12 into the body. Without enough intrinsic factor, your red blood cell count drops dramatically because your body cannot make new red blood cells without adequate amounts of vitamin B12. As a result, many of your organs don\u2019t function properly due to lack of oxygen. You might experience fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin color, numbness and tingling sensations in hands and feet, memory problems, depression, irritability, poor concentration, headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle weakness, weight loss, constipation, nausea, vomiting, bloody stools, difficulty swallowing, sore throat, mouth ulcers, dry eyes, hearing loss, vision changes, ring", "Pernicious anemia occurs due to lack of intrinsic factor production in the stomach lining cells.

Men older than age 80 tend to develop more significant symptoms due to enlargement of the prostate.", "Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is diagnosed based upon clinical findings such as increased frequency of urination at nighttime, difficulty starting urinary stream, weak flow rate, straining during voiding, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling following voiding, hesitancy/delayed start of urge to void, intermittent urgency, frequent daytime urges, nocturia (urinate 2 times per night), postvoid residual volume greater than 100 cc, suprapubic discomfort, lower extremity swelling, and decreased libido. In addition, BPH can be confirmed using ultrasounds, biopsies, MRI scans, and cystometry studies.", "Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is very common among men older than 50 years old. It occurs because the cells lining the prostate enlarge and multiply, causing pressure on the urethra. BPH affects about half of all men between ages 60 and 80. In some cases, BPH becomes so bad that it blocks the flow of urine out of the body. If this happens, it could result in frequent urination at night, difficulty starting urination, weak stream, strained urinary efforts, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling of urine following voiding, hesitancy, intermitent urge to urinate, and/or recurrent urinary retention.", "Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is not cancerous; however, some men experience problems such as difficulty starting urination, weak stream, frequent need to urinate at night, straining during urination, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling following voiding, hesitancy/delayed start of flow, intermittent stopping and starting of flow, and postvoid residual volume greater than 100 milliliters. These symptoms can affect quality of life and increase risk of developing acute urinary retention requiring hospitalization. In addition, BPH increases the likelihood of developing lower urinary tract symptomatic prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, erectile dysfunction, and stress urinary incontinence.", "Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) is not cancerous; however, it can still significantly impact quality of life due to its effects on the lower urinary tract system. BPH occurs when the cells lining the prostate grow out of control, causing pressure on the urethra and surrounding structures. As a result, men experience frequent urination at nighttime, difficulty starting urination, weak stream, strained urination, incomplete emptying of the bladder, dribbling following voiding, hesitancy/delayed start of flow, intermittent urgency, frequency, nocturia, and postvoid residual volume greater than 100 cc. These symptoms can negatively impact sleep patterns, sexual function, work productivity, social activities, and overall quality of life.", "Thyroid cancer occurs when cells within the thyroid grow out of control. These tumors can develop anywhere in the thyroid, although 80 percent of cases involve papillary thyroid cancer, which grows slowly and rarely metastasizes outside the thyroid. Other forms of thyroid cancer include follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer tends to affect younger women between ages 25 and 40 years old; however, all age groups can be diagnosed with any kind of thyroid cancer.", "Thyroid cancer is generally detected during routine physical exams because many times no signs or symptoms exist until later stages of the disease. If your doctor suspects thyroid cancer based upon your history and examination findings, additional tests such as ultrasounds, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans and biopsies may be ordered. These tests help determine the exact location, stage and grade of the tumors so appropriate therapy can be planned.", "Thyroid cancer is generally treated using radioactive iodine therapy, surgery or both. Radioactive iodine therapy uses radiation to kill any remaining cells in the body. It is used primarily for differentiated thyroid cancer, meaning that the tumors contain normal thyroid cells along with cancerous ones. In some cases, surgery alone is sufficient; however, many surgeries leave behind microscopic amounts of cancer cells that cannot be detected without further testing. These residual cells could grow into new tumors later down the road. Therefore, radioactive iodine therapy is given following surgery to ensure all traces of cancer are eliminated.", "Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism throughout the entire body. These hormones help control growth and development during childhood; however, once we reach adulthood our bodies no longer need these hormones. When the thyroid produces too much thyroid hormone, hyperthyroidism occurs. Hyperthyroidism can affect many parts of the body, such as the nervous system, muscles, eyes, skin, heart rate and weight. If not properly managed, hyperthyroidism can result in fatigue, anxiety, irregular menstrual cycles, increased sweating, heat intolerance, irritability, insomnia, palpitations, tremors, weight loss, thinning hair, brittle nails, frequent bowel movements, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive thirst, dry mouth, swelling around the neck, eye problems, vision changes, headaches, high cholester", "Thyroid cancer occurs when cells within the thyroid grow out of control. It affects about 50,000 Americans each year. Risk factors for thyroid cancer include exposure to radiation, especially during childhood; family history of thyroid problems; having had certain benign tumors removed from the thyroid; being female; and age older than 60 years old.", "Lifestyle choices such as eating right, exercising regularly and maintaining a positive outlook all play important roles in promoting overall good health and helping individuals recover from any kind of cancer. In addition, these factors help reduce stress levels, which can aid in the body\u2019s ability to fight off diseases. It is especially helpful to eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit, drink lots of fluids, limit alcohol consumption and keep your weight within normal limits. Exercise helps boost immune function and improves circulatory system efficiency.", "Hives are raised red welts that develop due to allergens such as pollen, pet dander, certain foods, insect bites, drugs and chemical irritants. These welts generally last less than 24 hours and disappear without any scarring. In some cases, however, these welts can persist longer and even turn into chronic hives. Chronic hives can last weeks or months at a time and can recur frequently throughout your lifetime. If you experience frequent episodes of hives, see your doctor so that you can determine what triggers your outbreaks.", "Hives appear as raised red welts on the surface of the skin. These welts can range in size from 1/4 inch up to about 6 inches across. They tend to last anywhere between minutes and days at a time. In some cases, these welts can join together into larger patches. Some individuals experience swelling around the eyes, lips, hands and feet during an outbreak of hives. Itchy rashes are another sign of hives. Sometimes, the rash appears first without any visible signs of hives until later. Other times, both the rash and hives develop simultaneously.", "Hives are commonly treated using antihistamines such as Benadryl, Zyrtec or Claritin. These drugs help reduce swelling and itchiness associated with hives. In some cases, corticosteroids might be prescribed to decrease inflammation. If these measures don\u2019t work, your doctor may suggest a short course of prednisone. Other possible treatments include cool compresses applied to the rash; topical creams containing calamine lotion, menthol or camphor; and ointments containing hydrocortisone.", "Stress can trigger many physical reactions, such as headaches, upset stomach and even rashes. Hives are red welts that appear on the surface of your body due to allergens coming into contact with your skin. These welts can last anywhere between 20 minutes and six hours. While some individuals experience hives only once during times of extreme stress, others develop chronic hives because of prolonged exposure to triggers. If you suspect that stress might be causing your hives, try reducing your daily stresses and see if your outbreaks decrease.", "Hives can last anywhere between 24 hours and six weeks. Most cases resolve within four days. If hives persist beyond seven days, your doctor might prescribe antihistamines or corticosteroids. In some instances, however, these drugs aren\u2019t effective enough to control the outbreak. Your physician may suggest immunotherapy \u2014 allergy shots \u2014 to help reduce future episodes.", "Hives are not only extremely annoying, but they can also be very scary because they come out of nowhere without warning. While some cases of hives cannot be avoided, many cases can be prevented simply by changing your habits. Some simple things you can try doing include wearing loose fitting clothes made of natural fabrics such as cotton; using hypoallergenic detergents; washing new clothes prior to wearing them; and avoiding perfumes, hair sprays and lotions containing fragrances. If these measures don\u2019t work, talk to your doctor about prescription antihistamines or allergy shots.", "Dengue fever is characterized by high fevers, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue. These symptoms generally last about 10 days; however, some individuals experience prolonged flu-like symptoms even after the initial phase passes. In rare cases, dengue fever can progress into a potentially fatal condition known as dengue shock syndrome. If you suspect you might have dengue fever, see your doctor immediately so proper diagnosis and treatment can take place.", "Dengue fever is transmitted via mosquito bites. Mosquitos carrying dengue viruses feed on humans during daylight hours and lay eggs near standing water sources such as buckets, flower vases, bird baths and swimming pools. Once infested, these containers must be emptied regularly so that new breeds cannot develop. In addition, individuals living in tropical climates need to take precautions to protect themselves from being bitten by mosquitos. These measures include wearing long sleeves and trousers at dawn and dusk; using insect repellent containing DEET; sleeping under bed nets; and spraying rooms with residual insecticides.", "Currently, no specific drug exists to treat dengue fever; however, supportive therapy such as rest, fluids and electrolyte replacement can help reduce some of its effects. In addition, antihistamines and analgesics can provide relief from headache, joint aches and muscle cramps associated with dengue fever. If dehydration occurs due to vomiting and/or diarrhea, intravenous rehydration must be initiated immediately.", "Prevention of dengue fever begins with reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Mosquitos carrying the viruses that cause dengue fever live near humans and breed in standing water. Therefore, eliminating sources of stagnant water around your home reduces the risk of being infected. In addition, wearing long sleeves and using insect repellent containing DEET helps reduce the number of mosquito bites. If you must spend time outdoors during peak season, try to limit your activities between dusk and dawn, when mosquitos are most active.", "Complications associated with dengue fever range from minor ones such as rash and joint aches to potentially fatal ones such as internal bleeding and organ damage. In rare cases, death occurs due to respiratory distress syndrome, shock, multiple organ system failures and/or sepsis.", "Recovery times vary greatly among individuals suffering from dengue fever. Some recover within days while others take weeks or months. In some cases, hospitalization is required due to dehydration, shock or respiratory distress syndrome. Most people experience flu-like symptoms such as high fevers, headaches, muscle aches, nausea/vomiting, rash and fatigue. These symptoms generally last about 10 days; however, some people continue to feel weakened even after these initial signs subside.", "Scleroderma is characterized by hardened patches of skin due to excess collagen production. These patches appear reddened at first, but eventually turn white because of lack of circulation. Other signs and symptoms associated with scleroderma include Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, calcinosis, esophagitis, pulmonary fibrosis, digital ulcers, telangiectasia, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, fatigue, joint stiffness, swelling of fingers and hands, and difficulty breathing.", "Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination during which your doctor looks at your skin closely for signs such as thickened patches of hardened skin, tight skin around joints and swollen fingers. Your doctor might also ask about any family history of autoimmune diseases because some cases of scleroderma run in families. In addition, your doctor might perform tests to rule out other possible disorders that could produce similar symptoms. These tests include X-rays, ultrasounds, CT scans and MRI imaging studies. If these initial tests don\u2019t provide enough information, your doctor might suggest biopsying a suspicious lesion so that a pathologist can examine cells under a microscope.", "Currently, no specific therapy exists for scleroderma; however, many treatments exist to help manage its effects. These range from topical creams used to reduce thickened patches of skin to immunosuppressant drugs taken daily to slow down the progression of the disease. In addition, physical therapists work closely with individuals suffering from scleroderma to improve mobility and strengthen muscles weakened due to decreased circulatory flow.", "In addition to causing hardened patches of skin, scleroderma can damage internal organs such as the lungs, esophagus, liver, intestines, kidneys and heart. It can also affect nerves, muscles and joints. Some individuals experience problems swallowing because scar tissues develop around the oesophagus. Other possible effects include difficulty breathing due to scarring of lung tissue; high blood pressure; irregular heartbeats; and stomach ulcers.", "Risk factors for developing scleroderma include being female, having certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or polymyositis/ dermatomyositis, smoking, exposure to silica dust, and having relatives with systemic sclerosis. It is important to note that not everyone with these risk factors develops scleroderma; however, those at higher risk need to pay attention to any new signs or symptoms so that early diagnosis and appropriate management can take place.", "Managing scleroderma symptoms depends largely upon what part of your body is involved. If you experience Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, try wearing gloves at nighttime during cold weather months. Wear loose fitting clothes made out of cotton material instead of nylons or tight jeans. Try not to smoke because smoking increases the risk of developing ulcers. You might want to consider using a humidifier in your home since dry air makes the problem even worse.", "In general, individuals suffering from Guillain\u2013Barre Syndrome experience weakness beginning at the feet and moving upward toward the trunk of the body. Other possible signs and symptoms include muscle spasm, difficulty breathing, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, numbness and/or tingling sensations throughout the body, and sometimes even paralysis. These symptoms generally develop within 24 hours of exposure to some sort of viral infection such as influenza, although not all cases involve a preceding viral infection.", "Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and neurological evaluation. In addition, your doctor might perform tests such as electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) to help confirm the diagnosis. These tests measure muscle strength and sensory function. Your physician might also request imaging scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic scan (CT) to rule out any underlying disorders.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is characterized by weakness and muscle wasting due to damage to nerves outside the spinal cord. It occurs suddenly and progressively gets worse until the person becomes totally immobile within days. In some cases, recovery begins almost immediately; however, many individuals continue to experience problems months later. Treatment depends upon the stage at which the disorder presents itself. If the initial signs and symptoms appear quickly, intravenous steroid therapy may help reduce the risk of permanent neurological deficits.", "In Guillain\u2013Barre Syndrome, the immune system attacks nerve cells in the peripheral nervous system, causing weakness and sometimes even temporary paralysis. It occurs when the body\u2019s own defense mechanisms attack its own nerves. The exact reason why this happens isn\u2019t known; however, researchers believe that certain viruses might trigger the disorder.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks its own nerve cells. It affects about 1 person per 100,000 each year worldwide. Risk factors for GBS include having had another autoimmune disorder such as multiple sclerosis; being male; having recently received certain vaccines; having been exposed to Campylobacter jejuni bacterial infections; and having recently given birth.", "Lifestyle modifications such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy can all play important roles in helping individuals cope with the effects of Guillain\u2013Barre Syndrome. Physical therapists work closely with patients to develop exercises designed specifically for each person based upon his/her needs. These exercises focus on improving strength, flexibility, balance and coordination while minimizing fatigue. Occupational therapists assist patients with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing and eating. Speech therapists provide assistance with swallowing difficulties associated with weakened muscles around the mouth and throat.", "Acromegaly occurs due to excess growth hormone production by the pituitary gland. It affects about 10 out of every million adults worldwide each year. Increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) stimulate cell division and increase bone density. These effects result in enlargement of facial features such as jawbone, nose, hands and feet; thickened lips; coarse hair; increased sweating; and decreases in vision. Other signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly include headaches, joint aches, fatigue, impotence, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, hypertension, colon polyps, and problems with memory and concentration.", "Acromegaly occurs when too much growth hormone is produced by the body\u2019s pituitary gland. It affects about 10 out of every million adults worldwide each year. Common signs and symptoms of acromegaly include enlargement of facial features such as the nose, jaw and tongue; thickened lips; coarse, oily skin; joint aches and stiffness; headaches; vision problems; impotence; and fatigue. In some cases, tumors develop within the pituitary gland itself. These tumors can press on nearby nerves and cause additional symptoms such as numbness around the mouth, hands and feet; difficulty swallowing; and changes in bowel habits.", "Acromegaly is diagnosed based upon clinical findings and lab tests. Clinicians look at signs such as enlarged hands and feet, thickened facial features, increased sweating, headaches, fatigue, joint aches/pain, vision problems, sleep apnea, impotence, high blood pressure, slow growth rate during childhood, etc., along with lab results showing elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and decreased levels of GH binding protein (GHBP).", "Acromegaly is a rare disorder characterized by excess growth hormone production due to benign tumors in the pituitary gland. It affects about 10 out of every million individuals worldwide each year. Treatment depends upon the stage of the disease at diagnosis; however, all cases eventually need surgery to remove the tumor(s) causing the problem. In addition, some patients benefit from radiation therapy, while others take drugs such as octreotide or somatostatin analogs to control the secretion of growth hormones.", "Acromegaly can result in many complications due to excess growth hormone production. These complications include joint problems such as osteoarthritis, soft tissues swelling around the eyes, hands and feet, enlargement of internal organs, increased risk of cancer, high cholesterol levels, sleep apnea and impaired vision. In addition, some individuals develop a benign tumor known as a pituitary adenoma. If not removed, these tumors can compress surrounding structures within the skull, resulting in headaches, visual changes and even death.", "Acromegaly is a rare disorder characterized by excess growth hormone production resulting in enlargement of various parts of the body such as hands, feet, jaw and nose. It affects approximately 10 out of every million individuals worldwide. In addition to physical changes, some patients experience emotional disturbances due to the effects of the disease. Proper diagnosis and management of acromegaly can help reduce these problems.", "BV is diagnosed based upon clinical findings such as discharge characteristics and odors. It is important to note that not all women with BV experience these signs and symptoms; some women only notice changes during sexual intercourse. In addition, many women with BV report no symptoms at all. If your doctor suspects you might have BV, she/he will perform a pelvic examination and take a sample of cervical secretions using cotton swabs. These samples are sent to a lab for testing.", "BV is characterized by increased discharge, odors and irritation around the vulva. Itchiness and burning sensations during intercourse are not unusual. Some women experience no symptoms at all. If your doctor suspects you might have BV, she/he will take a sample of secretions from inside the vagina using cotton swabs. These samples are sent off to a lab for testing. Your doctor may prescribe metronidazole cream or gel to apply directly into the vagina twice daily for five days. You must complete the full course of therapy even though your symptoms improve within 24 hours.", "BV is diagnosed based upon clinical findings such as increased discharge, odors, and/or grayish white discharge. It is important to note that not all women with these signs and symptoms actually have BV; therefore, testing is necessary prior to prescribing any therapy. If tests confirm the presence of BV, your doctor will likely prescribe metronidazole 500mg twice daily for seven days. You must take all dosages exactly as directed. Do not stop early because you feel better. Stopping too soon could result in recurrence of the infection.", "Bacterial vaginosis occurs when certain harmful bacteria grow out of control in the vagina. It is not clear what exactly triggers these changes, although some researchers believe hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy could play a role. Other factors such as douching, having multiple sex partners, using birth control methods containing spermicide, smoking and being obese might increase your risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.", "BV can increase your risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS, chlamydia and herpes simplex virus 2. It increases your chance of having preterm delivery during future pregnancies. And women with recurrent episodes of BV are at increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, which can result in infertility.", "BV cannot always be avoided because its exact cause remains unknown; however, certain behaviors increase your risk of developing the condition. These include having multiple sex partners, using douches, not washing properly between periods, wearing tight underwear, being pregnant, smoking and drinking alcohol excessively. If you experience any of these factors, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your chances of contracting BV.", "Epileptic seizures are characterized by sudden changes in behavior or physical movements due to excessive electrical activity in the brain. These episodes last anywhere between 30 seconds and five minutes. During these times, muscles contract involuntarily, causing convulsions. Someone having a seizure might lose consciousness, experience jerking motions, stiffen up, fall down, drool, foam at the mouth, chew or swallow something without meaning to, or even stop breathing temporarily. Afterward, some individuals feel confused, disoriented or dazed; others appear normal again immediately following the episode.", "Epileptic seizures are generally diagnosed based upon clinical history and physical examination findings. In some cases, additional tests such as electroencephalogram (EEG) testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, computed tomography (CT scan) scans, positron emission tomographic (PET) scans, single photon emission CT (SPECT) scans, spinal tap/lumbar puncture, and neurological exams may help confirm the diagnosis.", "Epileptic seizures are controlled using anti-seizure drugs such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, topirimate, gabapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, felbamate, vigabatrin, zonisamide, pregabalin, levetiracetam, ethosuximide, acetazolamide, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, muscle relaxants, opioids, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressant agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor agents, atypical antipsychotic agents, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, glutamatergic mod", "Epilepsy occurs when clusters of nerve cells in the brain send out electrical signals at the same time. These signals disrupt normal communication between neurons, causing convulsions and altered consciousness. In some cases, these spells last only seconds; however, others can continue for minutes or even hours. Some triggers for epileptic seizures include fevers, alcohol withdrawal, sleep deprivation, stress, flashing lights, certain smells, high altitudes, menstruation, hormonal changes during pregnancy and birth control pills, among many others.", "Lifestyle modifications such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, maintaining good sleep habits and managing stress levels all play important roles in helping individuals with epilepsy live full lives. In addition, some studies suggest that certain vitamins and minerals might reduce seizures. These include magnesium, zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, folic acid and B6. It\u2019s best to talk to your doctor about what nutrients would work best for you based upon your specific needs.", "Epileptic seizures can range from brief episodes lasting only seconds to long periods during which consciousness is lost. Some individuals experience multiple seizures per day while others go years without having any at all. In addition to these physical effects, many people living with epilepsy report emotional distress due to stigma associated with the disorder. Many people feel embarrassed about their diagnosis because they fear being judged negatively by friends, family members and coworkers.", "Pleural effusions refer to excess amounts of fluid between the lungs and chest wall. It occurs when too much liquid builds up around the lung because of problems such as cancer, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematous, scleroderma, thyroid disorders and viruses. In some cases, no underlying problem exists. Pleural effusions can make breathing difficult and cause shortness of breath. If not properly diagnosed and treated, these fluids could accumulate enough to compress the lining of the lung, causing respiratory distress.", "Pleural effusions are generally detected during routine chest X-rays taken for another reason. If your doctor suspects a pleural effusion based upon your history and physical examination, additional tests such as CT scans or ultrasounds might be ordered. These imaging studies help determine the amount of fluid accumulation within the space between the lungs and the ribcage. In some cases, a needle biopsy of the fluid itself might be necessary to confirm the presence of cancer cells.", "Pleural effusions are collections of excess fluid between the lungs and chest wall. These fluids accumulate because of problems with the lung itself, such as pulmonary embolism, cancer, pneumonia or COPD. Common signs and symptoms associated with pleural effusion include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, fatigue, decreased ability to perform activities due to discomfort, fevers, night sweats, weight gain/loss, swelling around the neck and shoulders, and persistent dry cough.", "Pleural effusions develop when excess fluid builds up between the lungs and chest wall. It occurs because of damage to the membrane surrounding the lung, such as due to cancer, infections, trauma or certain diseases. In addition, pregnancy and obstructed veins near the lungs can contribute to the development of these fluids. If not properly diagnosed and treated, pleural effusions can result in respiratory distress, difficulty breathing and even death.", "Pleural effusions are collections of excess fluid between the lungs and chest wall. These fluids can accumulate due to various reasons such as lung diseases, cancer, trauma or heart problems. In some cases, these fluids resolve without any intervention; however, sometimes additional measures need to be taken to drain the extra fluid. If the fluid collection is large enough, it could compress the lungs and make breathing difficult. It might even affect the function of the heart.", "Pleural effusions are collections of excess fluid between the lungs and chest wall. These fluids can accumulate due to various reasons such as lung diseases, cancer, heart problems, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary embolism, trauma, pregnancy and others. In some cases, these fluids go away without any intervention; however, sometimes they need to be drained out using thoracentesis. Thoracentesis is done under local anaesthesia and takes about 15 minutes. It helps reduce shortness of breath and improves quality of life.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with less serious problems such as indigestion, gas and bloating. As the tumors grow larger, however, some individuals experience jaundice, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort and back pain. In addition, many patients develop diabetes due to insulin production being impeded by the growth of the tumor.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with less serious problems such as indigestion, gas and bloating. In addition, many cases go undiagnosed until later stages due to lack of screenings. When pancreatic cancer is suspected based upon these symptoms, imaging tests such as CT scans, MRIs and ultrasounds are used to confirm the presence of tumors within the organ. If the results show evidence of cancerous cells, biopsies are taken so that pathologists can determine what kind of cellular changes occurred during development of the tumor.", "Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because its early signs and symptoms are similar to those associated with many less serious diseases. Once pancreatic cancer is detected, however, it must be removed immediately since it cannot be effectively treated once it reaches advanced stages. If caught at stage 1, the five year survival rate is about 20 percent; at stage 4, only four percent live longer than five years. Currently, no effective screenings exist for detecting pancreatic cancer earlier. Therefore, individuals need to pay attention to any changes in bowel habits, jaundice, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort and dark stools. These could all indicate pancreatic cancer.", "The pancreas produces enzymes that help break down fatty acids into smaller molecules so that your intestines can absorb these nutrients. It also makes insulin, which helps regulate sugar levels in the bloodstream. When the pancreatic duct becomes obstructed due to gallstones, cancerous cells or another problem, the flow of juices out of the pancreas slows down or stops altogether. As a result, the pancreas swells up because its internal pressure increases. If not treated promptly, the pancreas can die off entirely.", "Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells within the pancreas grow out of control and form tumors.
