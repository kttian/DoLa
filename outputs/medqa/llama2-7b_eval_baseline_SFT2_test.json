Other options include taking immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce the body's immune response, and biologic agents, which act by blocking certain chemicals in", "Scleroderma affects the skin and internal organs. As it progresses, the skin becomes hard and thick and may take on a shiny, bumpy appearance. This thickening also occurs in the walls of the small arteries in the skin, which can lead to skin ulcers and small blood clots. This thickening may also occur in the walls of the arteries that supply the heart and the kidneys. Internal organs affected by the condition include the kidneys, esophagus, stomach, intestines, lungs and heart.", "The risk factors for developing scleroderma vary by type. As the disease affects the connective tissues, the first risk factor is family history, since it tends to be a genetic disorder. However, not everyone with the disease has a family history, and the gene responsible has not been identified. Other risk factors are associated with smoking, which can increase the severity of symptoms.", "It is important to have regular checkups with a doctor, as scleroderma can be a chronic condition. It is also important to eat a healthy diet and maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the symptoms, such as tightness and stiffness in the joints, skin tightening, and shortness of breath, and report these symptoms to your doctor.", "The most common symptom of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is sudden weakness, typically in the legs. GBS can progress to involve the arms, hands, trunk, face, tongue and throat. Symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening and can come on suddenly, or can develop gradually. Other symptoms include numbness and tingling. There may also be difficulty swallowing, breathing or speaking. In severe cases, people may be unable to move at all, and will need to be on a ventilator to breathe.", "It is important to have a thorough medical examination to make a diagnosis of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. There are several ways to make this diagnosis, including blood tests, imaging tests, and nerve conduction tests. The results of these tests help to rule out other causes of weakness and determine the severity of the disease.", "The most important treatment for Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is immunoglobulin, which is a protein made from blood plasma. The protein contains antibodies that neutralize the immune system's response to nerve tissue, which is what causes the muscle weakness. Doctors also treat the symptoms of the syndrome, which can include pain and tingling in the arms and legs, as well as difficulty walking. In the most serious cases, people need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator to help with breathing.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. This type of disorder is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, where the body's immune system attacks its own nerves, causing the nervous system to malfunction. Symptoms of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome vary in severity from person to person, but often begin with tingling, numbness or weakness in the feet and legs. These symptoms then spread to the arms and upper body, eventually causing muscle weakness and difficulties with speaking, breathing and swallowing.", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. This is the system that is responsible for sending signals from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. It is the most common form of neuropathy, or nerve damage, in the United States. Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome may be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, but the most common cause is unknown. It is more common in older adults than in children and tends to occur more often in the winter and spring months.", "It is important to have a healthy lifestyle when living with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Following a healthy diet is a good first step toward managing the symptoms of GBS. People who suffer from GBS should limit their intake of refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, and eat more fruits and vegetables. The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which emphasizes a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, is particularly good for people with GBS. Getting plenty of rest and exercise can also help to manage symptoms.", "Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, which causes abnormal growth of bones, soft tissues and organs. A diagnosis of acromegaly is usually made when a patient presents with a combination of symptoms including bone or joint pain, abnormal growth of facial features, enlarged hands and feet, and excessive sweating. Acromegaly can be treated with medications that block the release of growth hormone, but in some cases surgery to remove the pituitary gland is necessary.", "The most common symptoms of acromegaly are enlargement of the jaw, brow and hands, and thickening of the lips and face. The condition can also cause hormone imbalances, leading to increased sweating, tiredness, diabetes, arthritis and high blood pressure. The condition is usually diagnosed with blood tests, and an MRI is used to confirm the diagnosis. Acromegaly can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy or medications.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone (GH). Acromegaly causes bone growths to develop on the skull, face, tongue, hands and feet. The condition is diagnosed using a blood test that measures the amount of GH in the blood, along with other tests that measure the function of the pituitary gland. X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also are used to diagnose acromegaly.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone (GH). Treatment is necessary for people with acromegaly because the excess GH can lead to numerous complications. The best treatment option for acromegaly is surgery, where the tumor is removed from the pituitary gland. Surgery can also be used to remove a portion of the pituitary gland in order to decrease the amount of GH that is produced. After surgery, the person will need to take medication to keep the pituitary gland from making GH again.", "Acromegaly is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone (GH). Complications can arise when this condition is not treated. The symptoms of acromegaly can include thickening of the skin, bone growth, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. Other complications that can occur include bone fractures, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, a weakened immune system, and many more.", "The prognosis for someone with acromegaly depends on whether the condition is caught early and whether it is treated appropriately. Acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. If this tumor is not removed, the patient can develop diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health problems. Surgical removal of the tumor is the only cure for this disease, but patients often need further treatment after surgery. The medical team at NYU Langone may also prescribe hormone replacement therapy and other medications to treat the symptoms and complications of acromegaly.", "Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed using a combination of clinical examination and laboratory tests. It is important to check for symptoms of bacterial vaginosis such as abnormal discharge, itching and burning. The doctor will use a cotton swab to take a sample of the vaginal discharge and send it to the laboratory for testing.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The condition can cause a variety of symptoms, including a fishy odor, white or gray vaginal discharge, and vaginal itching and discomfort. The condition can also cause pain and burning when urinating.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina, which is often accompanied by a strong, fishy smell. BV is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, but it can be spread from person to person through intimate sexual contact. Treatment typically involves an antibiotic, and if it is not cured, it can be treated with a probiotic. People with BV should also avoid using soap in the genital area and should clean the area with a waterless cleanser. Women should also avoid douching, as this may worsen symptoms.", "Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. The condition can occur at any time, but most often occurs when a woman is in her 20s to 30s and has a new sexual partner. The exact cause of bacterial vaginosis is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of factors, including having sex with a new partner, taking antibiotics, using a diaphragm for birth control, douching, using perfumed products in the vagina and having a history of a sexually transmitted disease.", "Bacterial vaginosis can lead to serious complications if it is not treated. If left untreated, this condition can cause bacteria to get into the uterus, cervix, or fallopian tubes. This could lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility. It is also possible for bacterial vaginosis to increase the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or HIV.", "It is recommended to avoid vaginal douching, as it changes the normal balance of vaginal flora and may increase the risk of getting bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is spread through sexual contact. Therefore, it is recommended to use condoms for protection against STDs. It is also recommended to use a spermicidal foam or gel to prevent pregnancy.", "Epilepsy is a condition that causes seizures. People with epilepsy may have no seizures, few seizures or numerous seizures that can occur many times per day. Some people with epilepsy also have learning disabilities or behavioral problems.", "Epilepsy is a condition that is diagnosed when a person has two or more seizures. However, seizures alone do not necessarily indicate that a person has epilepsy. There are many different types of seizures that can occur. An epileptologist (a physician specializing in the care of people with epilepsy) will review the patient's medical history and may request medical tests to evaluate the patient's condition. Tests may include an electroencephalogram (EEG), a diagnostic tool that records electrical activity in the brain, or an MRI of the brain. The tests will help to determine if the patient's seizures are being caused by a medical condition or by epilepsy.", "Epilepsy is a condition that is diagnosed when someone has had at least two seizures. However, not all seizures are the same. There are many different types of seizures, which can be caused by a variety of conditions. The most common types of seizures are called generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which are characterized by a loss of consciousness and shaking of the entire body. There are other types of seizures, such as absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, and atonic seizures, which involve different parts of the body.", "Epileptic seizures are a result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These seizures can be triggered by a wide range of causes, such as fever, sleep deprivation, alcohol use, head trauma and stroke. Seizures can also be caused by certain medications, such as those used to treat mental health conditions.", "It is important to have regular checkups with a primary care physician, as well as neurologists, to evaluate epilepsy and monitor any seizure activity. This may include imaging tests, neurological testing and medications. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including diet, exercise and stress reduction. Getting enough sleep and avoiding alcohol can also help reduce the risk of seizures.", "Epilepsy affects the daily life of both those with the condition and their families. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which people have seizures or periods of unusual behavior, usually caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can be mild or severe and can range from staring blankly into space to full-body convulsions.", "Pleural effusion occurs when the space between the lungs and the chest wall (pleural space) becomes filled with fluid, called pleural effusion. The space between the lungs and the chest wall usually contains a small amount of fluid. If this fluid builds up, it can press on the lungs and make breathing difficult. The fluid can also be caused by an infection in the lungs or in the pleural space. Pleural effusion can be caused by infections such as pneumonia, heart failure, cancer or autoimmune disorders. It can also be caused by an accumulation of lymph fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall. Pleural effusion is a common problem in people who have had a heart attack or stroke. It can be treated with antibiotics or by draining the fluid from the pleural space.", "Pleural effusion is often diagnosed with a chest X-ray, a CT scan or an ultrasound. However, if the X-ray shows no abnormalities, or if the cause of the effusion is unclear, additional testing may be needed. These tests can include a thoracentesis, which is a procedure in which a small sample of fluid from the pleural space is removed and tested to see if it contains an infection or cancer. The sample is sent to a lab for testing.", "Common symptoms of pleural effusion include shortness of breath and a wet cough. These are typically caused by fluid building up in the pleural cavity, the space between the lungs and the chest wall. In some cases, there may be a lump on the front of the chest or the patient may experience a sharp pain when they cough. Other symptoms include fever, weight loss, and shortness of breath even when resting. The diagnosis is made through a chest x-ray.", "Potential causes of pleural effusion include infection, cancer and heart failure. Pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the lining of the chest and the lungs. The most common cause of pleural effusion is pneumonia, although it can also be caused by certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer, and congestive heart failure.", "The most common treatment for pleural effusion is a thoracentesis, a procedure in which the doctor inserts a needle into the chest cavity to remove excess fluid. The fluid can be drained using a needle or a small tube. If a large amount of fluid needs to be removed, a chest tube may be inserted into the chest cavity. This procedure can take several days and will need to be repeated if the fluid builds up again.", "It is important to have a pleural effusion evaluated by a health care professional. There are many different causes of pleural effusion, and it is important to find out what is causing it. There are different types of pleural effusions, including those caused by fluid build-up and those caused by infections. Depending on the cause, the symptoms will be different, and a person may have symptoms in the chest, abdomen and even the head.", "Pancreatic cancer is often asymptomatic in the early stages and is often diagnosed after imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI, have been done to check for other possible conditions. In later stages, some patients may experience symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and vomiting.", "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed after a patient has experienced symptoms, which may include abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose because it is often asymptomatic and grows slowly. The patient's medical history, physical examination, CT scan, MRI, endoscopy and biopsy are all used to diagnose pancreatic cancer.", "Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is often not curable. However, some patients may be able to have surgery to remove the tumor and have a better chance at survival. If the tumor cannot be removed surgically, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for pancreatic cancer.", "The pancreas is a long, narrow gland located behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It produces enzymes that help digest food and hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. In some people, the pancreas can become inflamed and cause pain. The most common causes of this condition are infections and inflammatory diseases of the pancreas, such as pancreatitis. Symptoms of pancreatitis can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Pancreatitis is usually treated with medications, but in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the inflamed pancreas.", "Pancreatic cancer develops when a malignant tumor forms in the pancreas. It is a very serious disease, and one of the main risk factors is tobacco use. People who smoke have a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Other risk factors include obesity, certain genetic mutations, a diet high in red meat, and a diet high in fat and sugar. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer increases with age, but it is also possible for younger people to develop this disease.", "It is recommended to have regular checkups with a primary care physician, especially if you have a family history of pancreatic cancer.
