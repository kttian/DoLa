When symptoms do occur, they are often vague and nonspecific, such as abdominal pain, weight loss or jaundice. A doctor may order a blood test to check for elevated levels of the enzyme amylase, which is produced by the pancreas. If the level is high, an imaging test, such as an ultrasound, CT scan or MRI, may be ordered to look for tumors in the pancreas.", "There are several treatment options for pancreatic cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery is the most common treatment option for pancreatic cancer, but it is only an option if the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. If the cancer has spread, surgery may be used to relieve symptoms or to remove a portion of the pancreas. Chemotherapy can be used to shrink tumors before surgery or after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Radiation therapy is also used to kill cancer cells.", "The pancreas is a gland that lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It has two main functions: to produce digestive enzymes, which help break down food, and to produce insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. The pancreas also produces other hormones, including glucagon, which raises blood sugar levels when they are too low.", "Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the pancreas. The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the lower part of the stomach and in front of the spine. It is surrounded by other abdominal organs including the small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts. The pancreas has two main functions. One function is to produce insulin and other hormones that help control blood sugar levels. The other function is to produce enzymes that help digest food. Most pancreatic cancers begin in the exocrine cells", "There are no known preventive measures for pancreatic cancer. However, it is important to know your family history and talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have."], "name": ["Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis", "Esophagitis",
