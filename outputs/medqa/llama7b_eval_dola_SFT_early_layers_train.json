It occurs when a person ascends too quickly to a high altitude without allowing his or her body time to adjust. Symptoms of altitude sickness include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath and insomnia. If these symptoms are severe, a person should descend immediately to a lower altitude. If the symptoms are mild, the person should rest and drink plenty of fluids.", "Altitude sickness can develop within hours of arriving at a higher elevation. It is important to note that not everyone who goes to a higher altitude will experience altitude sickness. Some individuals may feel fine even though they are at a high altitude. However, those who do experience symptoms will likely notice them within 24 hours of arrival. Symptoms of altitude sickness include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath and insomnia.", "Alopecia areata is a condition that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It is not known what causes alopecia areata, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. In some cases, the hair loss is temporary and reversible, while in others, the hair loss is permanent. There is no cure for alopecia areata, but there are treatments available to help manage the condition. These include topical creams, steroid injections, oral medications and light therapy.", "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It affects about 2 percent of the population and is more common in women than men. The exact cause of alopecia areata is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an immune system problem. Common symptoms include patchy hair loss on the scalp, eyebrows or beard. Hair loss can also occur on the arms, legs, trunk and face. In some cases, the entire scalp may be affected.", "Alopecia areata is diagnosed based on the appearance of the hair loss. Hair loss can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most commonly seen on the scalp. It can also affect eyebrows, eyelashes, beards and pubic hair.

It is often asymptomatic until the later stages, at which point individuals may experience fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, muscle cramps, swelling, high blood pressure and changes in urination.", "Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed through a simple blood test that measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism. When the kidneys are not functioning properly, creatinine levels rise. Other tests that may be used to confirm the diagnosis include a urinalysis, ultrasound and kidney biopsy.", "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that affects the kidneys' ability to filter waste products from the body. It is typically diagnosed when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 60 milliliters per minute. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease and the underlying cause. In early stages, treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and reducing the risk of developing end-stage renal disease. This can be done through lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and quitting smoking. Medications may also be prescribed to help control high blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine.", "Chronic kidney disease occurs when the kidneys are not able to filter waste products from the body effectively. This can happen due to damage to the kidneys, such as from high blood pressure, diabetes or glomerulonephritis. It can also occur due to a blockage in the urinary tract, which prevents the kidneys from filtering properly.", "Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed based on the results of a blood test that measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism. When the kidneys are not functioning properly, creatinine levels rise. The stage of kidney disease is determined by the amount of creatinine in the blood. Stage 1 is defined as having a creatinine level between 1.0 and 1.4 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Stage 2 is defined as having a creatinine level between 1.5 and 2.9 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Stage 3 is defined as having a creatinine level between 3.0 and 4.9 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Stage 4 is defined as having a creatinine level greater than 5 milligrams per deciliter of blood", "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that can be managed with lifestyle changes and medications. Lifestyle changes include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking. Medications can help control high blood pressure and reduce protein in the urine. If these measures aren't enough to slow the progression of the disease, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary.", "Pellagra is a nerve disorder that results from a deficiency of vitamin B3, also known as niacin. It is characterized by four main symptoms: dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea and weakness. Dermatitis is a rash that appears on the face, neck, hands and feet. It is red and scaly and can be very itchy. Depression and confusion are common symptoms of dementia. Diarrhea is another common symptom of pellagra.

If the patient cannot tolerate these supplements, they may need to be given intravenously.", "Pellagra is a niacin deficiency that can be prevented by eating a balanced diet that contains enough protein, vitamins B3 and B6 and folate. Foods high in these nutrients include meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, peanuts, beans, leafy green vegetables, whole grains and fortified breads and cereals. Vitamin B3 is found in many animal products, while vitamin B6 is found in many plant products. Folate is found in dark green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, legumes, broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.", "Vitamin B3, or niacin, is the vitamin that leads to Pellagra.

Other symptoms of varicose veins include aching, heaviness, burning, throbbing, swelling and night cramps.", "Varicose veins are enlarged veins that appear blue or dark purple and are often found on the legs. These veins can be treated in a variety of ways, including wearing compression stockings, sclerotherapy, laser therapy and surgery. Compression stockings help improve circulation and reduce swelling. Sclerotherapy involves injecting a solution into the vein to make it collapse and fade away. Laser therapy uses a laser to heat the vein and destroy it. Surgery is used to remove the vein.", "Varicose veins are caused by weakened valves in the veins, which allow blood to flow backwards.
