The symptoms of Pellagra begin as diarrhea, which leads to skin rash and nervous system problems.", "Many people are surprised to learn that Pellagra is completely preventable. The most important thing to know is that this disease is caused by a nutrient deficiency. Vitamin B3, otherwise known as niacin, is the best known prevention, but there are others as well. A healthy diet will be able to provide enough niacin, as well as all of the other nutrients that the body needs. In the case of the Pellagra patient, this is not always enough to be completely cured. For that reason, other treatments must be used.\nThe first and most obvious treatment is a vitamin supplement. These should be used to ensure that the patient is getting enough niacin, and the supplements are designed specifically to be used for patients who have been diagnosed with Pellagra. Because this is a disease that affects the skin, the doctor may recommend a topical cre", "Many people are unaware of the dangers of eating corn-based foods because they do not live in the Southern United States. In the South, corn was the only grain available to poor farmers, so many were malnourished. The corn they ate was mainly grits or cornmeal, which were inexpensive and easy to prepare. These diets were deficient in the B vitamin niacin. In the early 1900s, medical professionals observed that certain people were having mental problems and liver disease. They eventually discovered that they had an insufficiency of niacin, a symptom of pellagra.\nIn 1938, the U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a campaign to prevent pellagra. In 1939, corn products were enriched with niacin, and the incidence of pellagra", "Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, is found in many foods and is required by the body for normal growth and functioning.

The veins have lost their ability to carry blood back to the heart.\nAs a result, the blood has to flow through the veins, which causes the veins to swell and become lumpy. The condition can be painful and may cause blood clots. Although it is not dangerous, the condition can become so painful that surgery may be necessary.\nVein Health Solution\nThe best way to manage varicose veins is through the use of compression stockings, which help to compress the veins and keep blood flowing back to the heart.
