Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart becomes enlarged and weak. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heart thicken. With restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart cannot relax normally, so the heart does not fill with blood properly. Finally, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy affects the right ventricle and leads to the development of an irregular heartbeat.", "People with cardiomyopathy often experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat, swelling in the legs, feet, ankles, abdomen, neck, head, weight gain, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, weakness, dizziness, fainting, confusion, poor memory, lack of concentration, insomnia, irritability, depression, personality changes, hair loss, cold intolerance, fatigue, rapid weight gain, fatigue, fatigue, weakness, tiredness, irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, swelling, cough, wheezing, excessive thirst, frequent urination, bloating, gas, constipation, indigestion, acid reflux, muscle cramps, joint pain, numbness, t", "A physician will perform a physical exam to evaluate the patient's vital signs, listen to the heart with a stethoscope and feel the chest for enlargement.

The disease is chronic and progresses slowly over time. Some patients do well for many years while others experience worsening symptoms that eventually require treatment. It is important for patients to work closely with their physicians to manage the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Lifestyle modifications are critical, as patients need to make significant lifestyle changes to improve the function of the heart. In some patients, these modifications can significantly slow the progression of the disease. In patients with worsening symptoms, medications are used to help the heart work better. Medications used to treat cardiomyopathy can have significant side effects, so patients should work closely with their physicians to determine the most effective medication regimen. In patients whose symptoms are not controlled with medications, an implantable defibrillator may be recommended to reduce the risk of sudden death. In", "In people with cardiomyopathy, it's important to eat a heart-healthy diet that's low in saturated fat, cholesterol, salt and sugar. Maintaining a healthy weight is important, as obesity puts added stress on the heart. Exercise is recommended, as long as the doctor gives the go ahead. It's best to start out slowly and work up to 30 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week. Talk to the doctor about medications that can help protect the heart, like beta blockers. It's important to quit smoking and limit alcohol intake.", "Osteoarthritis causes stiffness, swelling, tenderness, pain and decreased range of motion in the joint.

Being overweight puts extra stress on the knees, hips, ankles, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, back, hands, feet, hip, spine, sacroiliac and tailbone. Being active throughout one's lifetime helps to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis. It is important for individuals to maintain a healthy weight to protect the knees from excess pressure. It is important to wear proper footwear to reduce stress on the knees, ankles, hips, wrists, fingers, elbows, shoulders, neck, back, hands, feet, hip, spine, sacroiliac and tailbone. It is important for individuals to participate in low-impact exercises to reduce stress on the knees,", "While there is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, there are a number of lifestyle modifications that can help reduce joint pain and stiffness. Exercising regularly can improve range of motion, increase strength, reduce stiffness, improve balance, increase endurance and enhance mental outlook. Weight loss can help take pressure off the knee joint, while losing extra pounds can reduce stress on weight-bearing joints. Maintaining a healthy body weight can help protect the knees from developing osteoarthritis. Applying heat to sore joints can reduce stiffness.

Parents often notice delays in the first 18 months of a child's life, such as not smiling, pointing, or looking at others. Many children have unusual reactions to sights, smells, sounds, tastes, textures, light, color, movement, sound, taste, temperature, pain, and balance. Other signs and symptoms that parents and doctors look for are problems with eye contact, gesturing, and joint attention. Some children have unusual reactions to the way things feel, look, smell, and taste. For example, some children refuse to wear clothes that itch, scratch, or tag, while other children enjoy wearing the tags", "Diagnosing ASD involves a comprehensive evaluation that looks at a child's medical history, development, behavior, communication, cognition, sensory processing, adaptive skills, family and environmental factors. It's important for parents to seek a thorough evaluation from a team of medical professionals with experience in diagnosing ASD. In some cases, children with ASD are misdiagnosed with ADHD, a learning disability, mental retardation, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, seizure disorder, hearing impairment, vision impairment, language delay, motor delay, tics, head injury, metabolic disorder, allergies, celiac disease, thyroid dysfunction, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, mitochondrial disorder, kidney", "The current standard of care for autism is behavioral interventions.

Many children are diagnosed with autism between 24 and 30 months of age. In the U.S., approximately 1 in 68 children has some form of ASD. While the prevalence is higher among boys, about 1 in 42 has ASD. It's important to remember that everyone experiences ASD a little differently, so what works for one child with ASD may not work for another. Parents are encouraged to work closely with their child's medical team to create an individualized treatment plan.", "Risk factors for autism include a family history of the disorder, older paternal age at the time of the child's birth, a younger maternal age, a premature birth, a low birth weight, a male child, and exposure to valproic acid while in the womb. It is important to remember, though, that no single risk factor is known to cause autism. In addition, the symptoms and characteristics of the disorder can vary significantly among children.", "Parents should work with their child's therapists to come up with strategies to help improve their child's social skills. Sometimes children with ASD benefit from attending a summer camp that offers activities specifically designed for children with ASD. It's important for parents to teach their children the \"unwritten\" rules of social interactions, like using eye contact when speaking, holding hands while walking, or allowing another child to take the first turn at playing. Children with ASD benefit from learning the skills involved in having a conversation, such as sharing information, asking questions, taking turns and listening. Parents should practice these skills at home so that the child feels more comfortable using them in a group setting.", "Acne occurs when sebum, dead skin cells, dirt, bacteria, or cosmetics clog pores. Hormones are another possible cause. Hormone fluctuations, such as during puberty, pregnancy, menopause, or oral contraceptive use, can increase oil production, causing clogged pores. Some medications, such as corticosteroids, lithium, testosterone, or iodides, can also cause acne. Certain cosmetics, hair products, or cleansers can clog pores, leading to acne. Stress, poor nutrition, or not washing your face regularly can also contribute to acne.", "The best treatment for acne depends on the severity and location of the lesions, but the main goals are to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, reduce oil production, prevent scarring, and protect the skin from environmental irritants. Topical creams are the mainstay of acne therapy, and benzoyl peroxide is the main active ingredient. Oral antibiotics are effective, especially against cystic acne, and retinoids are very helpful against blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Isotretinoin is the gold standard against cystic acne, but it is very expensive and carries significant risks, so it is usually reserved for patients with severe cystic acne that does not respond to other", "Acne is classified into four main groups, and it is important for patients to understand which group they have because the treatment will vary. Inflammatory acne is the most severe and is marked by red, tender nodules that can become cystic. Nodulocystic acne is a severe form of inflammatory acne and is marked by large cysts that can cause scarring. Comedonal acne is the mildest form and is marked by whiteheads, blackheads, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, pimples, redness, scaling, oily skin, and possible scarring. Hormonal acne occurs during adolescence and pregnancy and is marked by noninflammatory lesions.", "Certain foods have been linked to acne, with dairy being the most well-studied. Several small studies have suggested a possible association between dairy consumption and acne, with the possible mechanism being the hormones found in milk. It is important to remember, though, that no strong conclusions can be drawn from the available research, and these results need to be confirmed in larger, better-designed studies. It is important to keep in mind, too, that some acne medications contain vitamin A derivatives, so patients taking acne medications should not consume large amounts of vitamin A.", "Poor hygiene has not been shown to contribute to acne, although poor hygiene can increase the chances of infection.
