As the brain is the most important organ in the body, a stroke can cause life-threatening complications. The symptoms of a stroke can appear suddenly and be very serious. Therefore, it is important to call 911 or other emergency medical help. The doctor will assess the symptoms and do a physical exam to determine if there is a blockage in the blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen and blood.", "There are several treatments available for stroke, depending on the type and severity of the stroke and the individual patient. The first priority after a stroke is to relieve the stroke's symptoms. Strokes can be treated with medications that help reduce swelling in the brain and control blood pressure. In the case of a blood clot, a person can be given an injection of a \"clot-buster\" medication, which dissolves the clot and restores blood flow. The medical professional may also give blood-thinning medication to prevent future strokes and to reduce the risk of heart attack and other blood vessel problems. People who have suffered a stroke may have physical, occupational or speech therapy to help them recover. In the case of hemorrhagic stroke, a surgical procedure to repair the damaged blood vessel may be done.", "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and is the leading cause of disability. However, there are risk factors that can increase your risk of stroke, and some of those risk factors can be modified. In some instances, stroke risk is not preventable, such as in individuals who have an inherited condition called stroke, but in most cases, it can be prevented. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and high cholesterol. People with high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol are at the highest risk of stroke. However, there are many other risk factors that can increase your risk of stroke, including heart disease, obesity, lack of exercise and excessive alcohol use.", "Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke and occur when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked, usually by a blood clot. The stroke can occur if a blood clot forms in another part of the body and travels to the brain, or if a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked. The stroke will cause an area of the brain to be deprived of blood and oxygen, and will result in brain cell death. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, and causes bleeding into the brain. These strokes occur when an aneurysm or weakened blood vessel wall ruptures and bleeds into the brain. Symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke include a sudden, severe headache, nausea and vomiting, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, dizziness, seizures, and loss of consciousness", "It is recommended that people try to stay healthy by eating well, exercising regularly and not smoking.

If you do have breast cancer, it is important to catch it early, so if your doctor finds any lumps or other signs of breast cancer, they will likely order additional tests.", "It is recommended that women ages 40 to 49 receive a mammogram every 1 to 2 years, and women ages 50 to 74 should receive a mammogram every 1 to 2 years. Women who have a family history of breast cancer or who have certain genetic mutations should be screened earlier, and women who are at higher risk of breast cancer may benefit from having a breast MRI in addition to a mammogram. Women should also do self-exams to check for any lumps or other changes in the breast tissue.", "The most common treatment for breast cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous breast tissue. These surgeries are typically done after the breast cancer has been diagnosed. Depending on the severity of the cancer, the surgeon may be able to completely remove the cancerous tissue and the surrounding lymph nodes. The surgery will be followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, if the breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the doctor may also suggest surgery to remove those lymph nodes.", "It is generally accepted that there are a number of risk factors that can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. However, the risk of developing breast cancer is not completely determined by these risk factors.

Some people may only experience mild symptoms, while others may have severe symptoms.", "It is important to have a thorough medical examination to make a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. However, there is no single test for diagnosing this condition. Doctors use a variety of tests to look for signs of the condition, such as dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue and certain blood tests. Doctors also will examine the eyes, mouth, tongue and throat, and may perform a biopsy of the salivary glands and lacrimal glands. People with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome often are treated with steroids and immunosuppressive medications.", "There is no cure for Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, but treatments can help reduce the symptoms. However, treatments cannot cure the disease, and people with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome must learn to live with the symptoms. The treatment options depend on the type of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome and the symptoms the person is experiencing. Treatments can be divided into three main categories: systemic, local and biologic. Systemic treatments are used to treat Sj\u00f6gren syndrome as a whole. These medications can be used to treat both the dry mouth and dry eyes symptoms. Common systemic treatments include steroids, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and methotrexate. These medications are not cures for Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, but they are designed to help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. People who take systemic medications may also require the use", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack and destroy its own moisture-producing glands, including the glands that make saliva and tears. However, it also affects many other organs. In many cases, the immune system attacks the white blood cells, which help fight infections. This results in a condition called \"lymphocytic infiltration,\" in which the body is unable to fight infections properly. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may also cause problems with the skin, digestive tract, and kidneys.", "Sj\u00f6gren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the glands that produce tears and saliva. This can lead to dry eyes and dry mouth, which can cause eye and mouth irritation, as well as difficulty eating and speaking.

People who have Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may also develop kidney disease or problems with their liver.", "It is important to have regular checkups with your primary care provider and an eye specialist. These doctors will be able to help monitor your condition and determine if any lifestyle changes or medications are needed. People with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome often find that lifestyle changes can help improve their quality of life. These changes include: Getting enough rest and eating healthy, exercising, and limiting alcohol consumption. People who smoke should quit smoking, as smoking can worsen symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. It is important to stay hydrated, so drinking plenty of water is essential.", "The most common symptom of athlete's foot is dry, itchy, and burning skin on the feet, and this condition can progress to blistering and scaling of the skin. A diagnosis of athlete's foot is typically made based on a person's medical history and physical exam. A common physical finding is a red, peeling skin rash on the feet, and in severe cases, blisters may appear on the skin. In most cases, the condition is self-limiting, and people can get relief by using over-the-counter antifungal creams and/or taking oral antifungal medications.", "Athlete's foot is a fungal infection of the skin, often affecting the feet and toes. It is caused by fungi that live on the skin and thrive in moist environments. Athlete's foot is typically treated with topical anti-fungal medications. The goal of treatment is to clear the infection, which can be difficult because the fungus grows deep in the skin and can be resistant to treatment. In severe cases, the infection can spread to other areas of the body, so early treatment is recommended.", "It is important to keep the feet clean and dry to prevent athlete's foot. It is also important to keep the feet away from tight-fitting shoes, and to wear clean, dry socks every day. In some cases, a person's shoes or socks may be the source of the infection. It is important to change shoes and socks at least once a day and to wash the socks often. It is also important to wear sandals in public showers or locker rooms.", "It is possible to develop athlete's foot in another part of the body, such as the groin, where the infection can be spread by sexual contact. It can also spread to the scalp, which can lead to hair loss. People who have diabetes or immune system problems are more likely to develop athlete's foot in other parts of the body. It is not common to develop athlete's foot in another part of the body, but if the infection spreads, it can be very uncomfortable and possibly lead to more serious infections in other parts of the body.", "Athlete's foot is a fungal infection of the skin, often affecting the feet and toes. It is caused by fungi that live on moist surfaces and spread through the air. These fungi can infect the skin on the feet. Although anyone can get athlete's foot, it is more common in men and in people with a weak immune system. People with athlete's foot will notice itchy, dry skin on the feet, especially between the toes. It may also cause blisters, sores, and redness on the feet and toes.", "It is important to treat athlete's foot as soon as possible, as the condition can lead to other complications if left untreated. Although not serious, the condition can spread to other areas of the body, which can lead to additional problems.

People who have a weakened immune system should always see a doctor if they suspect they have athlete's foot.", "The most common symptoms of altitude sickness include nausea, headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing, fatigue, and confusion. The condition can occur at any altitude over 8,000 feet, but is most common at elevations of 10,000 to 14,000 feet. If these symptoms do not improve in a few hours, the individual should descend to a lower altitude. The sooner the person is able to descend, the more quickly the symptoms will disappear.", "It is recommended to avoid drinking alcohol during the flight and sleeping at a high altitude during the flight. It is also important to eat plenty of food that contains carbohydrates, as carbohydrates help to avoid altitude sickness. Also, it is recommended to take rest breaks every two hours.", "It is recommended to avoid drinking alcohol during the first 24 hours in the high altitude. However, if altitude sickness occurs, it is recommended to take acetazolamide (brand name Diamox). Acetazolamide prevents fluid build-up in the lungs, and helps the body adapt to higher altitudes. If these symptoms do not improve, then acetazolamide should be stopped, and immediate medical attention is needed. In addition, symptoms of altitude sickness should be reported to a medical professional.", "Altitude sickness occurs when the body is exposed to high altitudes, often in the mountains. It is caused by low levels of oxygen in the air at high altitudes. This oxygen deficiency can cause mild headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and fatigue, but in some cases, the symptoms can become severe and cause death. The symptoms can take from 24 to 72 hours to show up, depending on the altitude.", "It is uncommon for altitude sickness to become severe or life-threatening. However, if symptoms persist, if they worsen or if they are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea or severe headache, it is important to contact your health care provider.", "It is generally best to ascend to high altitudes in stages rather than all at once. This will help to prevent the onset of symptoms of altitude sickness. Even if symptoms do not develop, altitude sickness can still be dangerous. Symptoms can appear as early as four hours after the ascent. This makes it very important to be prepared and avoid altitude sickness when possible.", "Alopecia areata is a disorder in which patches of hair fall out, often without an apparent reason. It is not known what causes the condition, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. In some people, the condition is not limited to the scalp and can affect the beard, eyebrows, eyelashes and other body hair. In severe cases, alopecia areata can lead to total hair loss.", "Alopecia areata is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. This type of hair loss is not caused by hormones or poor nutrition, but is believed to be an autoimmune disease. In many cases, alopecia areata is a benign, self-limiting condition and the hair regrows in six to 12 months. In others, hair may regrow but fall out again in a few weeks or months. The more hair loss, the longer it takes to grow back. In some cases, alopecia areata is linked to a more serious condition that involves the loss of hair from the scalp and other parts of the body. Alopecia areata can affect people of any age, but it is most common in children. In addition to hair loss, people with alopecia areata may experience other symptoms, such as red, swollen skin", "Alopecia areata is diagnosed by a medical professional using a microscope to look at the hair follicles to determine if they are becoming miniaturized.", "The most common treatment for alopecia areata is corticosteroid injections. These are injected directly into the scalp to encourage new hair growth. Topical treatments, such as minoxidil, can be effective as well. Topical treatments can include creams or solutions that are applied directly to the scalp. Other topical treatments can be used to stimulate hair growth, and some of these treatments can be purchased over the counter.", "It is more common in people under the age of 40 and people with a history of allergies, asthma or eczema. However, it can occur at any age, and there are no known risk factors.", "It is important to have a long-term strategy to manage Alopecia areata. It is likely that Alopecia areata will not go away, but it can be controlled. The goal of treatment is to keep the hair as thick as possible. For most people with Alopecia areata, the goal is to keep the hair at least 50 percent of the density it had before the condition began. People who have a good response to treatment may be able to wear wigs or hairpieces. The treatment depends on the individual, and many different treatments are used for Alopecia areata.", "Chronic kidney disease is a serious condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to do their job, and toxins and wastes begin to build up in the blood.

There are several treatments available, but if chronic kidney disease does not improve, a kidney transplant may be needed.", "Chronic kidney disease is the slow loss of kidney function over a period of months or years. It is a progressive condition, which means it gets worse over time. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and excreting them as urine. They also maintain the blood pressure and remove extra fluid from the body. Kidney disease can be caused by many things, including diabetes, high blood pressure, certain infections, and certain medications. People with chronic kidney disease often do not have any symptoms until the disease is advanced. Symptoms include fatigue, swelling in the feet, ankles, and legs, decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, difficulty concentrating, and changes in urination.", "Chronic kidney disease is a slow and progressive disease that can lead to kidney failure and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant.
